AWS Lambda --> 
  compute service that runs code in response to an event and manage compute resources full responsibility.
  
  Lab --> Serverless Image Thumbnail Application. (Thumbnail means small description or summary, is used to identify file content)

AWS API Gateway -->
  Microservies Architecture --> Each service in itself an individual application, fully automated and often HTTP API.
  
  Lab --> Build, deliver and maintain simple microservice, using Lambda and API Gateway.
  API --> Set of instructions how developers interface with an application.
  API First-Strategy --> Every service must be an individual API. This is becoming industry standard approach now.
  RESTful API --> 
    Representational State Transfer (REST) --> it mainly contain 6 imp architecture concepts
      a. seperation of concerns via client-server model.
      b. State is entirely stored at client, and clinet-server communication is stateless.
      c. client will cache data to improve network efficiency
      d. between client-server an uniform interface API is created
      e. it can handle multiple layers of components
      f. code-on-demand paatern (like Lambda function), No change at client side.
  API Gateway -->
      consist of defined resources, associated methods (GET, POST, PUT, etc), backend target
