AWS Well_Architected_Framework notes -->

Introduction --> 
by applying these practices you can consistently measure your architectures against best practices and identify areas for improvement.
The process for reviewing an architecture is a constructive conversation about architectural decisions.

5 Pillars of Well Architecture -->

Cost Optimization --> The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.
Operational Excellence --> The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.
Reliability --> The ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.
Performance Efficiency --> The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
Security --> The ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

Few imp terms used in doc-->
A "component" is the code, configuration and AWS Resources that together deliver against a requirement. 
We use the term "workload" to identify a set of components that together deliver business value. 
Milestones mark key changes in your architecture as it evolves throughout the product lifecycle (design, testing, go live, and in production).
We think about "architecture" as being how components work together in a workload. 
Within an organization the technology portfolio is the collection of workloads that are required for the business to operate.
