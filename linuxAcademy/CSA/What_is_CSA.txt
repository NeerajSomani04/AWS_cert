What is a Solution Architect?
--> is responsible for interpreting customer requirements and defining a solution following architecture design principles.
--> provide implementation guidance based on best practices throughout the lifecycle of project
--> a successful architect in AWS should have following:
  --> a. designing a resilient architecture, which is highly available and fault tolerant
  --> b. achieving maximum performance efficiency by leveraging caching, scalability and elasticity
  --> c. identify the most cost effcient solution for compute and storage
  --> d. knowing how to secure data, network and application
  --> e. choosing design features that enable oprational excellence

What is a well Architected Framework ??
Its a series of best practice recommendations and questions to ask when designing and developing cloud architecture.

A well Architected Framework and its pillars -->
Reliability --> 
Performance Efficiency --> 
Security  --> 
Cost Optimization --> 
Operational Excellence --> 

Lets discuss these in details -->

--> Reliability --> ability to recover from failure and mitigate disruption (Key Service - CloudWatch)
    Design Principles --> 
        --> Test Recovery procedures
        --> Automatically recover from failure
        --> Scale Horizontally
        --> Stop guessing capacity
        --> Automate change
    Best Practices -->
        --> Foundation --> Limit access, Isolate resources, Safeguard application
              Key AWS Services -->
                  IAM --> Access control
                  VPC --> Isolated network
                  Trusted Advisor --> service Limit
                  AWS Shield --> DDOS protection
        --> Change Management --> Monitor AWS API, key Matrics, Automatically Scale 
          Key AWS services --> cloudWatch, cloudTrail, Config, Auto-Scaling
        --> Failure Management --> Disaster recovery strategy, maintain backups
            key AWS services --> CloudFormation, S3, Glacier, KMS
            
            
--> Performance Efficiency --> use computing resources efficiently
--> Security  --> protect and monitor system
--> Cost Optimization --> avoid or eliminate unneeded expenses


--> Operational Excellence --> run and monitor systems to provide business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedure.
    Design principles --> 
        --> perform operations as code
        --> Annotate Documentation
        --> Make frequent, small, reversible changes
        --> Refine Operations procedure frequently 
        --> Anticipate failure
        --> Learn from all operational failure
    Best Practices -->
      Preparation --> Effective preparation --> 
          key AWS services that help this practice --> 
            cloudFormation --> operation as code
            Log Collection and Monitoring --> AWS config, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, flowLogs
      Operate --> Measure success with the achivement of business and customer outcome
            Key AWS Services -->
              CloudWatch --> Matrics Dashboard
              Insights/Details --> CloudTrail, flowLogs, X-Ray
      Evolve --> Evolve operations to sustain operation excellence
            Key AWS Service -->
              AWS Elasticsearch ---> Analyze log data
              Strong Devops Model --> (Developer Tools services) CodeBuild, CodeCommit, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, CodeStar, X-Ray
