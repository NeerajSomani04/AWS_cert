--> CodeDeploy --> automates deployment
  Deployment types --> 1. In-place (replace all EC2 instances, require some downtime)
        2. Blue.Green Deployment (3 ways, allAtOnce, HalfAtOnce, OneAtATime) 
            or (AllAtOnce, Linear, Canary {some percentage})
  AppSpec file --> details about deployment steps (BeforeInstall, AfterInstall, ApplicationStart, ApplicationStop, validateService (LifeCycle Hooks))        

--> CodePipeline --> CI/CD (continous software release process) --> set of steps to perform for every new changes in every release
    --> status of release process --> view alerts, retry process steps, etc
    --> CodePipeline creates S3 bucket for storing artifacts, (encryption at S3 can be by KMS-SSE-CMK, or AWS manager Key)
    components --> 
        --> pipeline --> stages {build, test, deployment} --> every stage contains one or more actions --> actions are applied on artifacts {code files}
  --> CodePipeline basically utilizes all development tools like, codeCommit, codeBuild, CodeDeploy, IAM role to work on these AWS services

--> CodeStar --> A quick service to start your project with utilizing all AWS resources.
  --> administor all needed AWS resoures and IAM roles/users as per specification,
  --> CodeStar well integrates with  CodeCommit, codeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, CloudWatch
