need to concentrate more on -->
Lambda- optimize deployment
Api gateway- cache
Lot of cognito question
Kinesis- stream/Firehose
Code deploy/ Pipe line/commit
DynamoDB R/W capacity calculations.
Cloudformation
IAM policies
  Kinesis
  CodePipline
  KMS and encryption: --> how to encrypt data in transit between different services. For example, EC2 to RDS or EC2 to S3, etc.
  Lambda Optimization --> Best practices --> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/best-practices.html 
  
Need to understand below in more details -->
--> from whizlab-cda-diagnostic-test --> 
1. ELB , sticky session feature benefits, limitations, (duration-based vs Application-controlled sticky session) - practice test 2 (Q17)
2. How elastic Cache can help in session managment for user? What is best method for maintain application session state when using ELB.

CDA topics -->
- Cloudwatch is now a huge topic
- Cloudtrail for API log troubleshooting
- VPC flow logs > though not strictly a topic, it was a possible answer for some question so having some knowledge here helps
- VPC security groups
- SAM (Server less Architecture Model)
- Cloudformation
- Systems Manager Parameter Store (only got one question here)
- Route53
- Troubleshooting is an important topic
- questions on system/account limits
major emphasis: Elastic Beanstalk, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, DynamoDB, s3, ElastiCache, ECS, RDS, AWS API, SNS, SQS. 
think scenarios --> For example, CodeDeploy to update ECS; or how to get human approvals with CodePipeline. You'll also want to know the components of SQS messages.
---> Also, sometimes two answers are equally correct but you can only choose one. What to do! Well if you get those -- as I did where the solution could be either RDS or DynamoDB -- prefer the serverless option first! Next, the more secure option. Next, the cheapest or easiset option (i.e. fewest services).
--> Learn how to read a SAML XML document. 

SAA preparation basics -->
Think of every service with 5 pillars perspective
Next step would be a combination of services and five pillars
(for example RDS+EC2+security or DynamoDB+EC2+performance or EC2+EBS+Cost. Try to add more layer (i.e. CloudFront) and see how to address those five pillars concerns.)
