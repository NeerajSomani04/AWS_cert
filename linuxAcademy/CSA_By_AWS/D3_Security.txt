Domain 3 - Secure application and architecture

1. Determine how to secure application tier
2. determine how to secure data
3. define and understand the networking infrastructure for single VPC application

Key concepts for Infrastructure --> 
1. Shared responsibility model
2. principle of least privilege
3. Identities (IAM) 

VPC is used to secure networking infrastruce -->

NAT Gateway --> is more scalable and AWS managed service. (No route table required, private instnace can directly connect to gateway)
NAT instance --> cheaper as this is single EC2 instance and cant scale. (route table with access to public ip is specified)

Security at Data tier -->
Data at rest --> ACL at bucket or object level, SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C, CSE-KMS, CSE-C
Data in transit --> SSL over web, VPN for IPsec, IPsec over AWS Direct Connect, Import/Export/Snowball, HTTPs
