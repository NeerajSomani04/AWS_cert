3. Billing and Support Services --> 

1. Lets build foundation -->

Cloud Terminologies --> 
High Availability --> (Highly Available) --> means, you can always access it (no downtime)
Fault Tolerant --> (self-healing, return to full capacity quickly) --> ability to handle most type of related failure
Scalable --> ability to easily grow in size, capacity and scope, as per need or on-demand
Elasticity --> ability to not only grow (scale) but also shrink when needed.

Benefits of AWS --> these are based on same above 4 terminologies
1. redundant backups 
2. easily share information across multiple devices and people

AWS Global Infrastructure -->
Region, AZ, & Data center --> globally located all around the world, consist of AZ, which consist of one or more data centers. 
These data centers are connected with each other with fast connectivity. 
These data centers are consist of various AWS services.

S3 --> fully managed bulk file storage service
EC2 --> A compute capacity service
AWS Shared Responsibility Model --> responsibility is shared among user and AWS

2. Explore Core AWS Services -->
IAM --> 
Storage Service --> S3 and its various classes
Networking services --> VPC
Compute Services --> EC2 and Lambda
ELB and Auto Scaling --> 
Content Delivery and DNS service --> CloudFront and Route53
Monitoring and Logging service --> CloudWatch and CloudTrail
Notification Services --> SNS
DataBase services --> RDS, DynamoDB, RedShift and Elastic Cache

3. Billing and Support Services --> 
1. Organization Managment --> 
    --> allows you (or your company) to manage billing and access to multiple AWS accounts (in one user interface).
    --> offers policy based management for multiple AWS accounts. 
    --> Create group for different accounts and apply policy to them together. (centrally manage policy for various accounts)
    --> you can also create service control policy (SCPs) that centrally control AWS service use across multiple AWS accounts.
    --> you can also use Organization to automate the creation of new account through APIs
    --> simplify billing by single payment option for multiple accounts
  
  Consolidated Billing Benefits --> 
     --> central location to manage billing across multiple accounts
     --> Gain volume discounts for usage across all your accounts

2. Pricing Model (how does pricing works) -->
    --> AWS belives in pay-as-you-go model. means only pay for what you use, when you use.
    --> No upfront cost, charges immidiately end as you stop service usage
    --> No long term contracts or complex licensing model
    --> volume discount can be available, so more you use cheaper it can become.
    --> no termination / cancelation fee
    --> free-tier option for 12 months with limited resources
  example:- 
      in case of S3 --> how much data you store, charged based on per GB, (region and storage class basis)
          --> also based on request type: moving data in/out of S3 (PUT/POST/GET/LIST request, lifecycle transition)
      in case of EC2 --> charged per second (based on hourly rate), for the amount of time instance is running
          --> hourly rates depends on instance option you select
          --> purchasing option (on-demand, reserved, spot), instance type, AMI type, region
          --> you are also charged for transfering data in/out of EC2
          
3. Billing and Cost tools --> 
    --> TCO (Total Cost of Ownership calculator)
      --> free tool, allows you to estimate and understand the cost of using AWS vs on-premises data center
      --> you or compancy can plan and avoid upfront expenditure on IT
      --> can provide directional guidance on cost savings
      --> you need to manually enter your requirement and it can estimate the rest
      --> Cost can be adjusted by adding or removing elements as you move along the project
    --> Cost Explorer --> 
      --> free tool, allows you to view your chart of your cost / expenditure
      --> cost data can be viewed upto past 13 months
      --> 3 month forecast is also available
      --> can be used to discover cost pattern, over-time costs, identify cost problem areas
      --> identify which service you use the most, which AZ has most traffic, which AWS account has most traffic
 
 4. Shared responsibility Model --> 
 
 5. Trusted Advisor and support --> 
      Account support plan --> added benefit of priority in support
        1. Basic --> free, with all accounts
        2. Developer --> starts at $29 per month
        3. Business --> starts at $100 per month
        4. Enterprise --> starts at $15,000 per month
        
      Trusted Advisor --> A service that "advises" and helps you optimize aspects of AWS account
          --> can help in reduce cost, increase performance, improve security
          --> real-time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices
       Categories --> 
          cost optimization
          performance
          security
          fault tolerance
          
       **** level of support also depends on type of account
