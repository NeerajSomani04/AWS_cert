1. Lets build foundation -->

Cloud Terminologies --> 
High Availability --> (Highly Available) --> means, you can always access it (no downtime)
Fault Tolerant --> (self-healing, return to full capacity quickly) --> ability to handle most type of related failure
Scalable --> ability to easily grow in size, capacity and scope, as per need or on-demand
Elasticity --> ability to not only grow (scale) but also shrink when needed.

Benefits of AWS --> these are based on same above 4 terminologies
1. redundant backups 
2. easily share information across multiple devices and people
