1. Lets build foundation -->

Cloud Terminologies --> 

--> High Availability --> (redundant backups) --> means, you can always access it (no downtime). multi-AZ architecture supports this.
--> Fault Tolerant --> (self-healing, return to full capacity quickly) --> ability to handle most type of related failure. means, not only --> highly available but also suffer no degradation in performance. Fault tolerant architecture requires extra redunancy and can be traded off with cost concerns.
--> Scalable --> ability to easily grow in size, capacity and scope, as per need or on-demand
    --> vertical scaling --> increase the capacity of single instance (add compute power to the same system)
    --> Horizontal scaling --> add or terminate number of instances (add or remove more systems)
--> Elasticity --> ability to not only grow (scale) but also shrink when needed. (scale out or in, updating firewall rules, remapping IP address)
--> Cost-efficient --> refer to making the trade-off required to make a system as inexpensive as possible while meeting all functional requirements.
--> Secure --> refer to following proper security guidelines and practices to secure a system at every layer.


AWS Global Infrastructure -->
Region, AZ, & Data center --> globally located all around the world, consist of AZ, which consist of one or more data centers. 
These data centers are connected with each other with fast connectivity. 
These data centers are consist of various AWS services.

2. Explore Core AWS Services -->
IAM --> 
Storage Service --> S3 and its various classes
Networking services --> VPC
Compute Services --> EC2 and Lambda
ELB and Auto Scaling --> 
Content Delivery and DNS service --> CloudFront and Route53
Monitoring and Logging service --> CloudWatch and CloudTrail
Notification Services --> SNS
DataBase services --> RDS, DynamoDB, RedShift and Elastic Cache

3. Billing and Support Services --> 
1. Organization Managment --> 
    --> allows you (or your company) to manage billing and access to multiple AWS accounts (in one user interface).
    --> offers policy based management for multiple AWS accounts. 
    --> Create group for different accounts and apply policy to them together. (centrally manage policy for various accounts)
    --> you can also create service control policy (SCPs) that centrally control AWS service use across multiple AWS accounts.
    --> you can also use Organization to automate the creation of new account through APIs
    --> simplify billing by single payment option for multiple accounts
  
  Consolidated Billing Benefits --> 
     --> central location to manage billing across multiple accounts
     --> Gain volume discounts for usage across all your accounts

2. Pricing Model (how does pricing works) -->
    --> AWS belives in pay-as-you-go model. means only pay for what you use, when you use.
    --> No upfront cost, charges immidiately end as you stop service usage
    --> No long term contracts or complex licensing model
    --> volume discount can be available, so more you use cheaper it can become.
    --> no termination / cancelation fee
    --> free-tier option for 12 months with limited resources
  example:- 
      in case of S3 --> how much data you store, charged based on per GB, (region and storage class basis)
          --> also based on request type: moving data in/out of S3 (PUT/POST/GET/LIST request, lifecycle transition)
      in case of EC2 --> charged per second (based on hourly rate), for the amount of time instance is running
          --> hourly rates depends on instance option you select
          --> purchasing option (on-demand, reserved, spot), instance type, AMI type, region
          --> you are also charged for transfering data in/out of EC2
          
3. Billing and Cost tools --> 
    --> TCO (Total Cost of Ownership calculator)
      --> free tool, allows you to estimate and understand the cost of using AWS vs on-premises data center
      --> you or compancy can plan and avoid upfront expenditure on IT
      --> can provide directional guidance on cost savings
      --> you need to manually enter your requirement and it can estimate the rest
      --> Cost can be adjusted by adding or removing elements as you move along the project
    --> Cost Explorer --> 
      --> free tool, allows you to view your chart of your cost / expenditure
      --> cost data can be viewed upto past 13 months
      --> 3 month forecast is also available
      --> can be used to discover cost pattern, over-time costs, identify cost problem areas
      --> identify which service you use the most, which AZ has most traffic, which AWS account has most traffic
 
 4. Shared responsibility Model --> 
 Security and Compliance is shared responsibility between AWS and customers.
 AWS responsible for -->
--> setup and maintainance of physical harware located at each AWS data center
--> physical security of data centers (locks, keys, security guards)
--> setup and maintainance of host virtualization software
 
 Customer responsible for -->
 --> Network level security (NACL, security groups)
 --> OS patches and updates
 --> IAM (user access management)
 --> client and server side data encryption
 
 5. Trusted Advisor and support --> 
      Account support plan --> added benefit of priority in support
        1. Basic --> free, with all accounts
        2. Developer --> starts at $29 per month
        3. Business --> starts at $100 per month
        4. Enterprise --> starts at $15,000 per month
        
      Trusted Advisor --> A service that "advises" and helps you optimize aspects of AWS account
          --> can help in reduce cost, increase performance, improve security
          --> real-time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices
       Best practice recommendation Categories --> 
          cost optimization (Idle resources, and capacity reservation)
          performance (High Utilization)
          security (IAM, Security Groups)
          fault tolerance (EBS snapshots, RDS backups, Multi-AZ)
          Service limits
          
       **** level of support also depends on type of account
 
 Six checks that cover basic security and performance check across any AWS account type -->
 1. Security Groups (port checks)
 2. IAM use
 3. MFA
 4. EBS public snapshot
 5. RDS public snapshot
 6. Service limits
    
Below security check option is only available for Business and Enterprise accounts -->
1. Access to Full list of Trusted Advisors checks
2. Notifications to stay-up-to-date with weekly resource deployments
3. Programmatic access to retrieve/refresh Trusted Advisor results via APIs
  
Things to consider if your Account compromised -->
1. Change you root account password
2. Change all IAM user's passwords
3. Delete or rotate all programmatic (API) access keys
4. Delete any resources in your account that you did not create
5. Respond to any notification you received from AWS through AWS support center or contact AWS support to open a case
