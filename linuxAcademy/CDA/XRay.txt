XRay --> traces request as they move through your application. 
It collects data make it available to view, filter and sort. This data can be used for optimization and analysis as well.

XRay Concepts -->
Segments --> Data about the work done by your application. (data related to request, response, subsegments, and issues)
Subsegments --> A more granular view of data inside of segments
Service Graph --> JSON doc, contains information about how your applications services and resource interacts. (visualize service map)
Traces --> this will trace all IDs as they go through your application
    1. first XRay supported service to interact with a request to add an HTTP trace ID to header
    2. trace ID propogates downstream to track the request as it move through application
Sampling --> XRay applies an algorithm to sample request data but you can configure the frequecy of sampling
    (i.e how to apply it on high volume or lower volume requests)
Tracing Header --> example (X-Amzn-Trace-Id: Root=1-5759e988-bd862e3fe1be46a994272793;Sampled=1)
Filter Expression --> used to search in your traces beased on (trace ID, portion of ARN URL, etc)
Annotation and metadata --> additional way to store searchable (annotation) and non-searchable (metadata) data about traces
Errors, Faults, and Exceptions --> Xray trace error and categorize them:
  Error – Client errors (400 series errors)
  Fault – Server faults (500 series errors)
  Throttle – Throttling errors (429 Too Many Requests)

X-Ray Service helpful in following ways --> 
    --> helps developers analyze and debug issues in distributed applications 
    --> helps in identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors.
    --> provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application

X-Ray Model --> X-Ray provides a user-centric model, instead of service-centric or resource-centric model, for collecting data related to requests made by user to your application.

What can I do with X-Ray?
--> Create a service map -->
--> Identify errors and bugs --> X-Ray can automatically highlight bugs or errors in your application code by analyzing the response code for each request made to your application.
--> Build your own analysis and visualization apps --> 

X-Ray metatdata Handling -->
--> Xray tracing information is available within 30 seconds of it being received by the service.
--> Xray trace data can be available for upto 30 days
--> in some situations it is possible that X-Ray trace information will be partial. (tagged as incomplete or partial)
--> X-Ray agent can assume a role to publish data into a different account
