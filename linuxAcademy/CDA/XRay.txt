XRay --> traces request as they move through your application. 
It collects data make it available to view, filter and sort. This data can be used for optimization and analysis as well.
X-Ray can be helpful to see bottlenack issues of your application. as it provides detailed chart about request/response time and status.

XRay Concepts -->
    Segments --> Data about the work done by your application. (data related to request, response, subsegments, annotations and issues)
    Subsegments --> A more granular view of data inside of segments
        For example, when your application makes a call to a database in response to a request, it creates a segment for that request with a sub-segment representing the database call and its result. The sub-segment can contain data such as the query, table used, timestamp, and error status. this data can be system-defined and user-defined data.
    Service Graph --> JSON doc, contains information about how your applications services and resource interacts. (visualize service map)
    Traces --> is a set of data points that share the same trace ID. 
        1. first XRay supported service to interact with a request to add an HTTP trace ID to header
        2. trace ID propogates downstream to track the request as it move through application
    Sampling --> XRay applies an algorithm to sample request data but you can configure the frequecy of sampling
        (i.e how to apply it on high volume or lower volume requests)
        --> To provide a performant and cost-effective experience, X-Ray does not collect data for every request that is sent to an application. Instead, it collects data for a statistically significant number of requests. X-Ray should not be used as an audit or compliance tool because it does not guarantee data completeness.
    Tracing Header --> example (X-Amzn-Trace-Id: Root=1-5759e988-bd862e3fe1be46a994272793;Sampled=1)
    X-Ray Agent --> X-Ray agent collects data from log files and sends them to the X-Ray service for aggregation, analysis, and storage. The agent makes it easier for you to send data to the X-Ray service, instead of using the APIs directly.
    Filter Expression --> used to search in your traces beased on (trace ID, portion of ARN URL, etc)
    Annotation and metadata --> additional way to store searchable (annotation) and non-searchable (metadata) data about traces
        --> X-Ray annotation is system-defined or user-defined data associated with a segment. (for example, region, AZ data)
        --> System-defined annotations include data added to the segment by AWS services, whereas 
        --> user-defined annotations are metadata added to a segment by a developer.
    Errors, Faults, and Exceptions --> Xray trace error and categorize them:
      Error – Client errors (400 series errors)
      Fault – Server faults (500 series errors)
      Throttle – Throttling errors (429 Too Many Requests)

X-Ray Service helpful in following ways --> 
    --> helps developers analyze and debug issues in distributed applications 
    --> helps in identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors.
    --> provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application

X-Ray Model --> X-Ray provides a user-centric model, instead of service-centric or resource-centric model, for collecting data related to requests made by user to your application.

What can I do with X-Ray?
--> Create a service map -->
--> Identify errors and bugs --> X-Ray can automatically highlight bugs or errors in your application code by analyzing the response code for each request made to your application.
--> Build your own analysis and visualization apps --> 

X-Ray metatdata Handling -->
--> Xray tracing information is available within 30 seconds of it being received by the service.
--> Xray trace data can be available for upto 30 days
--> in some situations it is possible that X-Ray trace information will be partial. (tagged as incomplete or partial)
--> X-Ray agent can assume a role to publish data into a different account
