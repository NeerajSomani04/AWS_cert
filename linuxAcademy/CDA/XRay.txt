XRay --> traces request as they move through your application. 
It collects data make it available to view, filter and sort. This data can be used for optimization and analysis as well.

XRay Concepts -->
Segments --> Data about the work done by your application. (data related to request, response, subsegments, and issues)
Subsegments --> A more granular view of data inside of segments
Service Graph --> JSON doc, contains information about how your applications services and resource interacts. (visualize service map)
Traces --> this will trace all IDs as they go through your application
    1. first XRay supported service to interact with a request to add an HTTP trace ID to header
    2. trace ID propogates downstream to track the request as it move through application
Sampling --> XRay applies an algorithm to sample request data but you can configure the frequecy of sampling
    (i.e how to apply it on high volume or lower volume requests)
Tracing Header --> example (X-Amzn-Trace-Id: Root=1-5759e988-bd862e3fe1be46a994272793;Sampled=1)
Filter Expression --> used to search in your traces beased on (trace ID, portion of ARN URL, etc)
Annotation and metadata --> additional way to store searchable (annotation) and non-searchable (metadata) data about traces
Errors, Faults, and Exceptions --> Xray trace error and categorize them:
  Error – Client errors (400 series errors)
  Fault – Server faults (500 series errors)
  Throttle – Throttling errors (429 Too Many Requests)
