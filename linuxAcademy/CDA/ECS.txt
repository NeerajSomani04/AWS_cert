    This allows to start, stop, manage, monitor, and scale each container independently
    
    Batch and ETL jobs -->
      package batch and ETL jobs into container and deploy them into EC2 clusters
      run different versions of the same job or multiple jobs on the same cluster
      share cluster capacity with other processes and/or grow jobs dynamically to improve resource utilization
    Continous Integration and Deployment -->

AWS Fargate --> is a way to use container as a fundamental application building block while AWS manages EC2 instance
