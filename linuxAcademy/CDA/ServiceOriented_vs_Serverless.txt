Service Oriented Architecture vs Serverless Architecture -->
    
    Microservices --> each microservice is a self contained unit of functionality on independent resources.
        --> communicate with each other using API
        --> decouple microservices using queue
    microservices components --> 
        Lambda function (serverless)
        messaging App --> (SQS, MQ)
        API Gateway 
        Containers (ECS, EKS)
        ELB, Auto-sclaing

Serverless Architecture means -->
  each service is seperate from each other and work independently for each task and pass control to other once done.
