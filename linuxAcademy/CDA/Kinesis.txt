Kinesis --> Analytics Service

Kinesis Essentials --> 
    Video Streams --> stream video to AWS, real-time or batch video processing and analytics
    Data Streams -->  
        --> ingest data from many sources
        --> real-time data processing application
        --> Kinesis connector -- EMR
        --> Data processed in sequence
        --> Server Side Encryption
      major components -->
        --> stream --> contains one or more shards
        --> shards --> (processing power) --> 1 MB/sec data input and 2MB/sec data output
                             --> distribute data to shards using partition key
        --> producer --> data creator
        --> consumer --> data consumer
    Firehose --> load streaming data to S3, Redshift, ElastCache, Splunk
    Data Analytics --> Run SQL queries against Data Streams or Firehose
    
Kinesis Benefits -->




    ------------ from aCloudGuru -------
    Streaming Data --> It is continously generated data in/by applications in small size (i.e, in KBs), through thousands of data resources 
      at same time.
  Kinesis --> AWS service for easily load and analyze streaming data.
  3 category of Kinesis service -->
    1. Kinesis stream
    2. K Firehose
    3. K Analytics
  1. Kinesis Stream -->
      All incoming data are stored in multiple Shard for default 24 hours (and can be increased to 7 days) --> Data retention period
      Shards --> high read/write throughput with distributed environment
  2. Kinesis Firehose -->
      Its more automated way of Kinesis Streams.
      >> In this we don't need to manage shards 
      >> data in automaticaly stored to S3 after processing. Consumer services can access from S3 anytime
      >> you can't directly send data to RedShift or RDS or DynamoDB, it has to go to S3 first then to any other services.
      >> Firehose can send data directly to S3, ESC (ElasticSearch Cluster)
  3. Kinesis Analytics -->
      >> Allows user to write SQLs and analyze data that exists in FireHose or Stream.
