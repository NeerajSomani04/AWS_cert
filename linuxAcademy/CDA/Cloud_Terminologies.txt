Cloud Terminologies --> 

--> High Availability --> (redundant backups) --> means, you can always access it (no downtime). multi-AZ architecture supports this.
--> Fault Tolerant --> (self-healing, return to full capacity quickly) --> ability to handle most type of related failure. means, not only --> highly available but also suffer no degradation in performance. Fault tolerant architecture requires extra redunancy and can be traded off with cost concerns.
--> Scalable --> ability to easily grow in size, capacity and scope, as per need or on-demand
    --> vertical scaling --> increase the capacity of single instance (add compute power to the same system)
    --> Horizontal scaling --> add or terminate number of instances (add or remove more systems)
--> Elasticity --> ability to not only grow (scale) but also shrink when needed. (scale out or in, updating firewall rules, remapping IP address)
--> Cost-efficient --> refer to making the trade-off required to make a system as inexpensive as possible while meeting all functional requirements.
--> Secure --> refer to following proper security guidelines and practices to secure a system at every layer.


AWS Global Infrastructure -->
Region, AZ, & Data center --> 
globally located all around the world, consist of AZ, which consist of one or more data centers. 
These data centers are connected with each other with fast connectivity. 
These data centers are consist of various AWS services.
