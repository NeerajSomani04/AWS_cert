1. General --> 
  --> With the help of Cognito its easy to add user sign-up and authenticate through mobile devices and web-apps.
  --> even it allows you to authenticate users through external identity provider and provides temporary security credentials to access your app’s.
  --> support SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) or other providers like (facebook, amazon, google)
  --> syncronize data across devices
  --> benefit --> customer should focus on building creative apps without worrying about building, securing, and scaling a solution to handle user management, authentication, and sync across platforms and devices.
  --> Congnito can be used using server-side APIs, SDKs, or using console
  --> cognito supports both web-identity provider as well some other user defined or enterprise provider (windows AD group, etc)
  --> user pool is used, where you securely stores your users’ profile attributes
  --> user pool can be configured in AWS account using console, skds, or cli
  --> Identity pools are the containers that Cognito Identity uses to keep your apps’ federated identities organized. 
  --> Cognito Identity console shows you how many identities were created via the Cognito Identity APIs

Q: How does the login flow work with public identity providers?
--> mobile app authenticates with an Identity Provider (IdP) using SDKs
--> Once the end user is authenticated, the OAuth or OpenID Connect token or the SAML assertion returned from the IdP 
--> then this received token will be passed to Cognito Identity 
--> Cognito returns a new Cognito ID for the user and a set of temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials.

Q: What if I don’t want to force my users to log in?
Cognito Identity supports the creation and token vending process for unauthenticated users as well as authenticated users.
this enables you to use temporary, limited privilege credentials to access AWS resources.

--> Cognito Identity supports separate multiple identities on a single device, such as a family iPad. Each identity is treated separately 
--> store data in the form of key/value pairs. The data is stored both locally on the device and in the Cognito sync store. 
--> There is no limit to the number of identities you can create in your identity pools and sync store.

silent push notification? --> received by your application on a user's device that will not be seen by the user.

Cognito Pricing --> Pay by monthly active users, total amount of data saved in Cognito, 

Cognito Stream --> used to analyze information stored in Cognito.
  Amazon Cognito Streams gives developers control and insight into their data stored in Amazon Cognito. Developers can now configure a Kinesis stream to receive events as data is updated and synchronized. Amazon Cognito can push each dataset change to a Kinesis stream you own in real time.
  
Cognito Events --> Amazon Cognito Events allows you to execute an AWS Lambda function in response to important events in Amazon Cognito. 
    --> example, this lambda function can be used to validate data before it is saved to Cognito
Cognito Data --> users data
Cognito Callback --> By implementing the "SyncCallback" interface, you can receive notifications on your app about dataset synchronization.
