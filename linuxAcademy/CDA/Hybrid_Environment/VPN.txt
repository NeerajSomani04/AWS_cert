Virtual Private Network (VPN) --> allows you as an architect to bridge the gap between on-premise and cloud resources.
    with an AWS VPC, you can extend subnet from the cloud to your data-center and vice versa.

VPN Essentials -->
  --> enables the ability to extend network from one geographycal location to another
  --> traffic traverses through internet
  --> means extending on-premises network to cloud and vice versa
  
  --> from AWS stands point, this allows us to connect AWS resources (like EC2 instances) without need for public IP address or internet gateway.
  --> also an additional level of security as traffic traverse through VPN is encrypted
  
  --> VPN connection has two parallel routes (IPsec Channel), which is for redundancy
  --> Only one Virtual Private Gateway can be attach to VPC (just like IGW)
  --> A VPC can have one IGW and one VPG at the same time

Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) --> 
  --> suite of secure network protocols for IPv4 (layer 3)
  --> provides mutual Authentication
  --> provides encryption, negotiation of keys

example, VPN flow diagram -->
On-premises DC --> Customer Gateway --> VPN connection --> VPG at VPC --> Router table --> subnet --> EC2
  
Customer Gateway -->
  --> is a physical device or software application at on-premise location that act as "connector" to VPN connection.
  --> this is the component at on-premises where we configure public IP address for other application
      2 ways 
      --> static routing --> you define routes
      --> dynamic routes --> route automatically propogates, automatic failover
              --> Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
              --> Autonomous System Number (ASN)

VPN connection --> Actual link between VPG and Customer Gateway
  --> this is setup / configure in AWS
  --> each connection uses two IPsec tunnels for redundancy 

Virtual Private Gateway (VPG) --> acts as "connector" on VPC (AWS) side on VPN connection
      --> VPG is connected to VPC
      --> Target for Route tables
      --> Cloud hub --> multiple customer network
      
** Note: Both VPG and Customer Gateway are required to make VPN connections

Router --> 
  --> AWS has dispensed the concept of having users physically setup and manage a "router".
  --> route tables are actually part of router assigned to your VPC
  --> Hence, route table must include the route for on-premises network that are used by VPN, and point them to VPG. 
      Choose Route propogation for BGP to automatically add the routes.
