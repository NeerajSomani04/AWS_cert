EC2 Essentials -->
  scalable virtual server on cloud, runs on Linux/Windows, 
  very similar as on-premises servers, with flexibility of on-demand scalabale
  
  Components -->
    AMI --> OS, software packages, and other setting image (preconfigured packages)
    Instance type --> hardware compute power, RAM, network bandwidth
    Network Interface --> public, private, elastic IP address
    instances storage --> "hard-drive"
      EBS (Elastic Block Storage) --> network persistent storage
      EFS (Elastic File storage) --> scalable, elastic file storage
      Instance storage --> "ephemeral storage" -- temporary / short time storage
 Facts --> 
  1. security groups must be assigned at time of creation
  2. Each instance must be placed into an existing VPC, AZ, and subnets
  3. custom launch command (bootstarping) can be passed at the launch
  4. "Tags" used to name and organize
  5. Encrypted Key-Pair used to login
  6. there is limit on number of instnaces running at specific time within a region

EC2 instnace types -->
  1. compute power (processor/CPU) {C}, {P, G, F}
  2. memory (RAM) {X, R}
  3. Storage Optimized (Hard-drive) {H, I, D}
  4. Network Performance (bandwidth)
 General purpose {T, M}

EC2 Purchasing Options -->
  On-Demand --> 
    choose, provision and terminate any instnaces type at any time
    most expensive, most flexible
  Reserved Instances -->
    purchase for set time period (one or 3 year) with significant discount (pay upfront, partial upfront, no upfront)
    Regional RI and AZ specific RI
  Spot Instance -->
    bid for specific instance type, substantial discount, terminate at anytime
  Dedicated Instnaces --> dedicated machine with full control, save money and works with specific regulatory compliance
  
EC2 Instance Configuration --> 
  IP Addresses -->
    Public --> Have option to enable/assign public IPs, used to access EC2 over the open internet, IPs assigned as per selected subnet
    Private --> By Default, all EC2 created with Private IPs, used for internal inside VPC communication
    Elastic --> Static but public IP address designed for dynamic cloud computing, 
      with EIP, you can attach an public IP to EC2 that was created with private IP
      attaching an EIP will replace default public IP, as long as EIP is attached.
   
   Bootstrapping --> set of independent commands run at the time of instnace launch
   User-Data --> custom commands can be used at time of launch for specific user (i.e, bash scripts)
   Below command to view user-data & meta-data  -->
      curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data   (displays bootstrapping commands)
      curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data   (displays AMI, instance types, etc)
 
 EC2 Storage Basics -->
  EBS Basics --> EBS volumes are persistent, network attached storage (meaning attach/detach to/from EC2 instances)
      --> However, one EBS volumes can be attached to one instnace at a time
      --> SnapShots can be created from EBS, that can be used to create new EBS volume
      --> By default, EBS volumes replicated within AZ
  EBS Performance -->
    EBS volumes measures in IOPS (means input/output operations per sec, in 256kb chunks, {512 kb operations = 2 IOPS})
