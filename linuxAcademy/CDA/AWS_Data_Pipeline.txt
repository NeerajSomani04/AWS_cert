AWS Data Pipeline is a web service that you can use to automate the movement and transformation of data.
you can define data-driven workflows, so that tasks can be dependent on the successful completion of previous tasks.

For example, you can use AWS Data Pipeline to archive your web server's logs to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) each day and 
then run a weekly Amazon EMR (Amazon EMR) cluster over those logs to generate traffic reports. AWS Data Pipeline schedules the daily tasks 
to copy data and the weekly task to launch the Amazon EMR cluster. AWS Data Pipeline also ensures that Amazon EMR waits for the final 
day's data to be uploaded to Amazon S3 before it begins its analysis, even if there is an unforeseen delay in uploading the logs.
