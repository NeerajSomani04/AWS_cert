S3 Buckets -->
  Buckets are main storage container of S3.
  S3 buckets and objects resides within region where it got created, untill explicitly transfered.
    This brings low latency, minimize cost and address regulatory requirements
    Every bucket must have unique name across all of AWS.
 Buckets limitation -->
    100 per AWS account, Bucket ownership cant be transferd, Bucket can hold unlimited objects
S3 Objects -->
  Objects are static files and metadata information.
  Metadata means, storage type, encryption settings and permissions.
  Storage type, determines objects availability, durability, and cost.
  By default, all objects are private.
  Objects --> 0 byte to 5 TB
    multiple versions (if versioning enabled)
    every object can be access via URL
    Storage Lifecycle policy
    Encrypted
    Objects Organized within folders
  Objects Encryption -->
    SSE (Server Side Encryption) --> AES-256, encryption at S3 level
    Client Side Encryption --> Client uses 3rd party tool, or some other encryption technology

S3 Essentials -->
  Bulk static object storage
  various storage classes to optimize cost vs needed object availability and durability
  object versioning
  S3 bucket/object restriction policies/permissions
  Origin for cloudFront CDN
  S3 objects stays within region but synced across AZs for high availability, durability

S3 Read consistency rule -->
  read-after-write --> PUT for new object
  Eventual consistency --> PUT for overwriting existing objects and DELETE for objects
S3 Errors -->
  404 --> Not found
  403 --> Forbidden
  400 --> Bad request
  500 --> server error
S3 Event Notification --> AWS services like SNS, Lambda, SQS
