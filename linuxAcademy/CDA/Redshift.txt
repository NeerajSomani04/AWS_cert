Redshift Essential --> petabyte scale datawarehouse service, fully-managed and scalable
    --> generally used for big data analytics

Amazon Elastic Cache and Caching stretegy -->
  Elastic Cache Essentials --> 
    fully managed, in-memory cache engine used to improve DB performance by caching frequently used query results
    great for large, high-performance DB
     Elastic Cache allows for managing web-session, also caching dynamically generated data 
    currently available engines plugins are (Memcached & Redis)
    application should be compatible with these Caching plugins
    
  Caching stretegies -->
    Lazy Loading --> cache will be loaded only when already not exists (means when cache miss occurs) and avoid to load data that was never requested. This usually implemented with some other maintainable stretegies to avoid data stale.
    write through --> cache will always be updated with new write and update requests to keep it up-to-date, usually implement it with TTL
    TTL --> time-to-live, TTL not guarantee fresh information, but helps in cleanup and implemented with any of above 2 options
