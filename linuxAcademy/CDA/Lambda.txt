Lambda Essentials -->
  Serverless computing platform --> means run code without provisioning or managing servers
  Lambda allows you to configure the amount of resources (memory, CPU) available to user function
  pay only for compute time code consume, in millisec
  by default Lambda is, highly available, scalable, fault tolerant, cost effective, elastic
  Lambda Functions and Lambda function packages are core concept for programming pplication based on Lambda
  Lambda easily integrates with other AWS services
  Lambda supported languages --> Node.js, JAVA, C#, Python, GO
  --> Environment variables can be set to point different services in lambda
  --> tagging is helpful to add meta-data of your function in the logs
  
Lambda Events -->
  Lambda functions are triggered by events. example, like S3 file upload, DynamoDB changes, cloudWatch scheduled events, etc.

Lambda Functions --> consists of nothing but application code and dependent libraries, packages
  lambda functions can invokes as: --> using Invoke API call, using below Invocation type
    Synchronous : wait for return value and return it
    Asynchronous: Don't wait for return value, discard it
 Note:- When Lambda function triggered from an event, the type of invocation is determined by the service invoking the function.
 
Lambda Function Configuration -->
  Lambda requires significatly less configuration and managment, but you can still customize it:
    --> different programming language options and runtime environments
    --> the handler (each function has a handler file and function, format of the lambda handler value is filename.functioname, ) 
    --> Memory (128 MB to 3008 MB) - {in 64MB increment each time}. (default it 128 MB)
    --> CPU allocation sclaes based on memory
    --> max execution duration (300 sec) - in 1 sec increments. (default is 3 sec)
    --> permissions (Through IAM roles, or resource based access control policies, these policies needs to be set through CLI/SDK, can't be done through consol and it uses STS/Cognito for security)
    --> ** Environment Variables (in form of key-value pair to set environment at runtime env (dev, stage, prod), can be encrypted using kMS)
    --> we can configure SQS or SNS to get details about function failure
    --> concurrency --> we can specify the max no of concurrent execution of function (limit 1000)
    --> Tags - can be attached to function
 
 Lambda Function Packages --> zip package file include code and any dependencies
  --> handler file, custom or third party packages
      
Lambda Versions and Aliases --> used to manage code for production vs other environment (dev/qa) for different releases
  1. versions --> each version of function stored with unique ARN
    $LATEST --> this represents latest lambda function version, rest all with version number and this is the only mutable (changable version)
    Numbered Version (like 1 or 2) --> these are immutable, start with number 1 and increment by 1
  2. Aliases --> are pointer to specific lambda function version
       Alias can be used to call specific function without knowing version of function
       Alias have static ARN and can be used to point to any version of the same function
       Alias can also be used to split traffic between lambda functions versions
  Benefits of both --> easier development workflow and management of stages.

Lambda API actions --> need to visit on AWS website if needed.
  AddPermission --> add permission to AWS resource
  CreateFunction --> create new lambda function
  Invoke --> this invokes the needed lambda function, with Invocation Type (Event (Asynchronous) or RequestResponse (default and used for Synchronous))
  CreateEventSourceMapping --> this identifies a stream as an event source for a lambda function. This association between a stream source and a lambda function is called the event source mapping. (example, lambda function will be triggered when records are posted to the stream)


When to use Lambda over EC2 --> Generally when you want to run code in resoonse to an event -->
example:- change to S3 bucket, updates to DynamoDB table, Kinesis Stream, SQS queue

Q:-- What Configuration information needed for Lambda Function to Access Resources in an Amazon VPC
Answer:- VPC subnet IDs and security group IDs. 

example --> 
The create-function CLI command specifies the --vpc-config parameter to provide VPC information at the time you create a Lambda function.
$ aws lambda create-function \
--function-name ExampleFunction \
--runtime go1.x \
--role execution-role-arn \
--zip-file fileb://path/app.zip \
--handler app.handler \
--vpc-config SubnetIds=comma-separated-vpc-subnet-ids,SecurityGroupIds=comma-separated-security-group-ids \
--memory-size 1024

 Lambda Best practice notes --> https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/best-practices.html
  --> Avoid using recursive code in your lambda function
  --> your function should have some conditional checks to avoid infinite loops
  --> in-case of some accidental recursive code, set the function concurrent execution limit to '0' (zero) to throttle all invocation to the function, and correct your code.
  



  
Quiz Notes -->
  1. A Lambda deployment package contains: Lambda function packages or 'deployment packages' must include function code and all the dependencies required for the function to work. They do not need to include a binary for the language runtime.
  2. two arguments a Python Lambda handler function require: event, context
      The event data contains the request data passed into Lambda form the event that triggered it. The context object provides useful methods for interacting with the context of the current execution (for example, time remaining in the execution or the AWS request id)
  3. When referencing the remaining time left for a Lambda function to run within the function's code you would use: 
    answer: "The context object" will give you access to a method to get the remaining time left in function execution. For example, in Python this would return the remaining time in milliseconds: context.get_remaining_time_in_millis()
4. Logs for Lambda functions are actually stored and accessed in CloudWatch.
5. Lambda requires you to specifically allocate certain resources. Which of the following can you adjust directly yourself?
    answer: Execution timeout (max is 300 sec) and Memory
