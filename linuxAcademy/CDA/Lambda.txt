Lambda Essentials -->
  Serverless computing platform --> means run code without managing servers
  pay only for compute time code consume, in millisec
  Lambda, highly available, scalable, fault tolerant, cost effective, elastic
  Lambda Functions and Lambda function packages are core of it
  Lambda easily integrates with other AWS services
  Lambda supported languages --> Node.js, JAVA, C#, Python, GO
  
Lambda Events -->
  Lambda functions are triggered by events. example, like S3 file upload, DynamoDB changes, cloudWatch scheduled events, etc.
Lambda Functions --> nothing but application code
  lambda functions can invokes as:
    Synchronous : wait for return value and return it
    Asynchronous: Don't wiat for return value, discard it
Lambda Function Configuration -->
  Lambda requires significatly less configuration and managment, but you can 
  
Lambda Versions and Aliases -->
  labmda versions are stored as unique code function with their own unique ARN
  $LATEST --> this represents latest lambda function version, rest all with version number
  Lambda Aliases --> are pointer to specific version
      Alias have static ARN and can be used to point to any version
      Alias can also be used to split traffic between lambda functions
  Benefits of both --> ease deployment workflow and management of stages

Lambda API actions --> need to visit on AWS website if needed.
