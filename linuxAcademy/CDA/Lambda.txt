Lambda Essentials -->
  Serverless computing platform --> means run code without managing servers
  pay only for compute time code consume, in millisec
  Lambda, highly available, scalable, fault tolerant, cost effective, elastic
  Lambda Functions and Lambda function packages are core of it
  Lambda easily integrates with other AWS services
  Lambda supported languages --> Node.js, JAVA, C#, Python, GO
  
Lambda Events -->
  Lambda functions are triggered by events. example, like S3 file upload, DynamoDB changes, cloudWatch scheduled events, etc.
Lambda Functions --> nothing but application code
  lambda functions can invokes as:
    Synchronous : wait for return value and return it
    Asynchronous: Don't wiat for return value, discard it
Lambda Function Configuration -->
  Lambda requires significatly less configuration and managment, but you can 
  
Lambda Versions and Aliases -->
  labmda versions are stored as unique code function with their own unique ARN
  $LATEST --> this represents latest lambda function version, rest all with version number
  Lambda Aliases --> are pointer to specific version
      Alias have static ARN and can be used to point to any version
      Alias can also be used to split traffic between lambda functions
  Benefits of both --> ease deployment workflow and management of stages

Lambda API actions --> need to visit on AWS website if needed.
  
Quiz Notes -->
  1. A Lambda deployment package contains: Lambda function packages or 'deployment packages' must include function code and all the dependencies required for the function to work. They do not need to include a binary for the language runtime.
  2. two arguments a Python Lambda handler function require: event, context
      The event data contains the request data passed into Lambda form the event that triggered it. The context object provides useful methods for interacting with the context of the current execution (for example, time remaining in the execution or the AWS request id)
  3. When referencing the remaining time left for a Lambda function to run within the function's code you would use: 
    answer: "The context object" will give you access to a method to get the remaining time left in function execution. For example, in Python this would return the remaining time in milliseconds: context.get_remaining_time_in_millis()
4. Logs for Lambda functions are actually stored and accessed in CloudWatch.
5. Lambda requires you to specifically allocate certain resources. Which of the following can you adjust directly yourself?
    answer: Execution timeout (max is 300 sec) and Memory
