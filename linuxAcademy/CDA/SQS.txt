SQS Essentials --> 
    useful for highly available queue that is used to send and receive messages
    useful to build distributed/decoupled architecture
    Messages between servers are retrived via "polling" (pulling)
    can encrypt queue messages using AWS KMS
    each message size can be upto 256 kb 
    SQS offers 2 types of Queue --> standard queue and FIFO queue
    First 1 million request are free, then $0.50 PER EVERY MILLION REQUESTS
    
two types of polling --> (pulling) mechanism
  Long polling --> (1-20 seconds) wait untill a message is available in the queue before sending response, 
  --> check all server / services before sending empty response back to caller
  --> hence reduces API request occurs when message waitTimeSeconds > 0
  short polling --> increases API request and hence increase cost
        SQS samples subset of servers and returns messages just from those servers
        will not return all possible messages from poll
        Short polling occurs when waitTimeSeconds = 0 for both queue or message, when using ReceiveMessage API
        if message waitTimeSeconds > 0, then it overrides the queue's waitTimeSeconds

SQS Queue --> highly reliable hosted message store. (TTL is 1 min to 14 days)
2 type of queues --> 
   standard queue --> supports nearly unlimited number of messages per second
        supports multiple producers/consumers
        guarantee delivery of messages atleast once with best effort ordering
        used with application that can tolerate or handle duplicate messages
        support 120,000 in-Flight messages
   FIFO queue --> supports upto 3000 messages with batching and 300 messages without batching (per second)
        supports multiple producers but only supports multiple consumers through use of GroupID:
            GroupIDs can be used to interleave multiple ordered message groups within a single FIFO queue
            Messages are processed in-order with respect to the group but not always with respect to the other groups
      FIFO guarantee that message are sent atleast once and processed in order, for applications where order is critical
      usually designed with application where duplicate messages can't be tolerated
      supports 20,000 in-Flight messages
        
SQS producers --> any service that send messages to SQS queue, eg:- EC2 instance, Lambda, ECS services, even few external services
SQS Consumer --> any service that consumes and process SQS messages, also responsible for deleting messages from queue. (Lmabda, ECS)

Queue Settings --> ** imp
  Dead letter queue --> used to deal with malformed data from consumers
  DelaySeconds --> how long messages take to be added to the queue upon creation
  VisibilityTimeOut --> How long messages are invisible after being received by consumer and wait for response from consumer
 
SQS resource based access control policies --> all points are same as SNS. 
    can be used to grant access to SQS queues to another AWS account
    SQS AddPermission API automatically generates the ACL policy to SQS
    These policies can also be used to grant access to some AWS services to public to your SNS topic (although, many service like EC2 or Lambda will use IAM Role instead for SNS)
    IAM role and Access control policies can be used at the same time.
    SQS allows anonymous access via IAM policies to access message queue
 
SQS message characteristics and Limitations -->
    message --> a set of instructions that will be relayed to the worker instance via SQS Queue (upto 256 kb text in any format)
  {XML, JSON, unformatted} text upto 256 kb, can contain upto 10 metadata attributes outside of message body
  for larger messages we can use S3.
  To send messages larger than 256 kb, we can use Amazon SQS extended client library for Java. This library point a reference to S3 for larger messages (more than 256 kb)
  server side encryption
  time-to-live from 1 min to 14 days in SQS queue
  visibilityTimeout --> upto 12 hours, this becomes invisible after being pulled by called and wait for deletion.
  messages can be added to dead letter queue if consumers unable to process them for debugging purposes
  There is no limit on creating queues in SQS

message components -->
  Body --> XML, JSON, unformmated text 
  receiptHandle --> a message attributes that allows you to delete the message after being received and processed 
  messageAttributes --> custom attributes can be set outside of message body to SQS queue
  visibilityTimeout --> length of time message will be invisible after received by consumer and wait for process by them and response to delete
  DelaySeconds --> length of time queue will wait before initially placing message to the queue
  
SQS API -->
  CreateQueue --> start by creating your queue
  GetQueueURL --> use this to return the URL you need for future actions
  SendMessage --> used by producer to send message to queue
  ReceiveMessage --> used by consumers to receive messages
  ChangeMessageVisibility --> used to set message visibility (but if you set within processing of a message then whatever visibility timeout you set will be addition of already time spent + addition as per command, example, 2 + 5 = 7 overall)
  DeleteMessage --> consumer finish processing and delete message
  ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds --> long polling timeout 1 to 20 seconds 
  MessageRetentionPeriod --> The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message. (1 min to 14 days, in seconds)
  
Sample SQS workflow could be similar to this -->
    --> Generally a worker instance will pull a queue to retrieve waiting messages for processing
    --> Lambda function can now replace worker to pull and process messages
    --> Auto scaling can be applied based on queue size so that if a component of your application has an increase in demand the number of worker instances can increase.
    
Tightly coupled or decoupled Architecture -->
   Tightly couple Architecture -->
        --> In this system the components are not only linked with each other but also dependent on each other.
        --> if one component fails, all other will get impacted means will fail or will not run
   Loosely coupled or decoupled components -->
        --> these have multiple component that can work without even being connected, means if one fails the rest of the system still up and running. Its fault-taulerent and highly available.

Few points from Udemy Test -->
When you have loosly coupled architecture and some systems are in offline / online mode to process the message in SQS:
   --> you can use SNS to fan-out message to SQS specific to each consumer. So, that each consumer can process message as soon as they come online.
    --> If you have messages with different priority (High, Medium, Low) and you want to process message based on priority then you need to create seperate SQS queue for them. Standard queue would be best.
        Also, While FIFO message group id supports grouping messages. It does not guarantee which group id would be returned first. FIFO supports order of messages.
 
--> Developers can handle stuck messages (messages that have not been successfully processed by a consumer) with Dead Letter Queues. When the maximum receive count is exceeded for a message it will be moved to the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) associated with the original queue

Question -->
You have a FIFO Queue named pending_order.fifo.  Your application uses a distinct order_id as a Group ID for the message.  Each message has a different group ID.  What is the observed behavior when there are multiple consumers trying to read from the queue?
Answer --> 
--> When requesting, client cannot request for messages from specific group ID. FIFO maintains order of processing within a group ID. Since every message has a different group ID, it is not ordered in any way. Hence, this scheme maximizes concurrency.


SDKs can handle many functionality and more useful then APIs.
