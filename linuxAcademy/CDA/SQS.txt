SQS Essentials -->
  ability to have/hosted highly avilable queues
  Helpful is developing distribute/decoupled application
  each message size upto 256 kb 
  2 type of queues --> 
    standard queue --> supports nearly unlimited number of messages per second
      supports multiple producers/consumers
      guarantee delivery of messages atleast once
      application should be able to handle duplicate messages
    FIFO queue --> supports upto 3000 messages with batching and 300 messages without batching
      FIFO guarantee that message are sent atleast once and processed in order
      usually designed with application where duplicate messages can't be tolerated
    
  SQS is also highly available and redundant and can encrypt queue messages using KMS
  
  It worked with polling (pulling) mechanism
    two type of polling -->
      Long polling --> (1-20 seconds) wait untill a message is available in the queue before sending response, hence reduces API request
      short polling --> increases API request and hence increase cost

SQS producers --> any service that send messages to SQS queue
SQS Consumer --> any service that consumes and process SQS messages, also responsible for deleting messages from queue.

Queue Settings -->
  Dead letter queue --> used to deal with malformed data from consumers
  DelaySeconds --> how long messages take to be added to the queue upon creation
  VisibilityTimeOut --> How long messages are invisible after being received by consumer and wait for response from consumer
 
SQS resource based access control policies --> all points are same as SNS. 
  it supports both ACL and IAM policies
