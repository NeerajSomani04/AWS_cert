VPC Essentials -->
  VPC enable you to launch AWS resources into virtual network. This is very similar to on-premises data center but scalable.
  
  Private and public features of VPC -->
    private and public subnets, scalable architecture
  
  Important VPC facts -->
    A VPC spans across multiple AZs within a Region. High availability and fault tolerant architecture.
    Each VPC has its own hostname.
  Benefits of VPC --> 
    Ability to launch instances into subnet
    Ability to define custom CIDR inside each subnet
    Ability to configure routes between subnets
    Ability to configure Internet Gateway to provide route to internet
    Ability to create layered network of resources
    Ability to extend corporate/on-premise network to cloud via VPN/VPG
    Layered Security -->
      Instance level security groups (firewall on the instance level)
      subnet level network ACLs (firewall on the subnet level)
   
Default VPC features -->
      preconfigured VPC will be created at the time of AWS account creation
      Default VPC and non-default VPC has significate differences
      In default VPC, all subnet have a route to inetrnet via route table and attached IGW.
VPC Limits -->
    5 VPC per region (more can be requested)
    5 Internet Gateway per region (this is equal to VPC, because one VPC can have One IG)
    50 customer Gateways per region
    50 VPN connections per region
    200 route tables / 50 entries in each table
    5 Elastic IP address per region
    500 Security groups per VPC / 50 rules per security groups
    5 security groups per network interface (or considered 

VPC Networking -->
  Internet Gateway -->
    allows the communication between instances and Internet.
    it can scale horizontally, highly available and redundant
    there is a risk of no availability and risk bandbwidth constraints on network
    Provides NAT translation for instances that have public IP address assigned (public IP to private IP)
    Default VPC always comes with IGW attahced.
  IGW rules -->
    one IGW per VPC at a time
    IGW cant be detached from VPC while there is any active AWS resources on VPC (like EC2, RDS)
    IGW is must when communication needed between internet and AWS resources on VPC
  Route Tables -->
    it contains set of rules that used to determine where netwrok traffic is directed, called routes.
    2 major components -->
      Destination --> CIDR block range of target
      Target --> a name identifier where data is directed
    By default, all subnet traffic is allowed to each other within VPC, and its can't be modified.
    Can have more than one route table
    can't delete route table if it has dependencies, (associated subnets)
    Default VPC always comes with one default route table.
    Best practice, is to untouch default route table and create new needed route table.
 Subnets -->
    can add one or more subnet in each AZ
    subnet doesn't span across AZs
    A subnet must be associated with route tables
    A public subnet has a route to internet, means that public subnet is associated with a route table that has an IGW attached.
    A private subnet doesn't have a route to internet, means private subnet associated with a route table doesn't have an IGW attached.
 NACLs -->
    ACL operates at network and subnet level
    supports both DENY and ALLOW rules
    NACLs are stateless
    NACLs process rules in sequencial orders for allow or Deny on same port
    Last rule in every NACL is catch all "DENY" rule
    NACL is optional layer of security for VPC, that controls in and out traffic of one or more subnets.
    Best practice to incremenet rules by 10 numbers, so that if needed some rule can be fit in between.
    Note: Default VPC already have a NACL and that is associated with default subnets.
 Security Groups -->
    are security at instnace level, as oppose to NACL which is at subnet level.
    Security groups also has allow/deny rules, same as NACL, but works differently:
      security groups supports only allow rules, by default everything is denied.
      They are stateful, means return traffic is by default allowed regardless of rules
      all rules are evaluted before deciding to allow traffic.
    Best practice is to allow only those trafffic that is required.
 
 VPC Networking -->
    Auto Scaling --> This is an AWS service, that automates the process of increasing or decreasing the number of instances as per need.
        This above concept is also known as elastcity of AWS environment.
      Auto scaling components -->
        Launch Configuration --> EC2 templates needs to be used at the time of provisioning additional instnace
        Auto Scaling Groups --> contains all the rules and settings that govern if/when EC2 instance automatically provisioned /                       terminated.
VPC - Bastion Host and NAT Gateway -->
    Bastion Host --> an EC2 instance that lives in a public subnet and used as a Gateway for traffic that destined for instances lived          in private subnet.
       This is the "critical strong point" of network. Very tight security rules should be considered.
    NAT Gateways --> used to provide access to internet, for EC2 instances that resides at private subnet.
      This will prevent any host outside of VPC to make connection to instnace on private subnet.
      NAT gateway only allow incoming traffic if request was initiated from instnace reside at private subnet.
      **NAT Gateway must be created in public subnet.
      **Be part of private subnets route table.
    NAT Instance --> purpose is identical to NAT Gateway, however executed differently by configuring actual EC2 instnaces
