VPC Essentials -->
  VPC enable you to launch AWS resources into virtual network. This is very similar to on-premises data center but scalable.
  
  Private and public features of VPC -->
    private and public subnets, scalable architecture
  
  Important VPC facts -->
    A VPC spans across multiple AZs within a Region. High availability and fault tolerant architecture.
    Each VPC has its own hostname.
  Benefits of VPC --> 
    Ability to launch instances into subnet
    Ability to define custom CIDR inside each subnet
    Ability to configure routes between subnets
    Ability to configure Internet Gateway to provide route to internet
    Ability to create layered network of resources
    Ability to extend corporate/on-premise network to cloud via VPN/VPG
    Layered Security -->
      Instance level security groups (firewall on the instance level)
      subnet level network ACLs (firewall on the subnet level)
   
Default VPC features -->
      preconfigured VPC will be created at the time of AWS account creation
      Default VPC and non-default VPC has significate differences
      In default VPC, all subnet have a route to inetrnet via route table and attached IGW.
VPC Limits -->
    5 VPC per region (more can be requested)
    5 Internet Gateway per region (this is equal to VPC, because one VPC can have One IG)
    50 customer Gateways per region
    50 VPN connections per region
    200 route tables / 50 entries in each table
    5 Elastic IP address per region
    500 Security groups per VPC / 50 rules per security groups
    5 security groups per network interface (or considered 

VPC Networking -->
  Internet Gateway -->
    allows the communication between instances and Internet.
    it can scale horizontally, highly available and redundant
    there is a risk of no availability and risk bandbwidth constraints on network
    Provides NAT translation for instances that have public IP address assigned (public IP to private IP)
    Default VPC always comes with IGW attahced.
  IGW rules -->
    one IGW per VPC at a time
    IGW cant be detached from VPC while there is any active AWS resources on VPC (like EC2, RDS)
    IGW is must when communication needed between internet and AWS resources on VPC
  Route Tables -->
    it contains set of rules that used to determine where netwrok traffic is directed, called routes.
    2 major components -->
      Destination --> CIDR block range of target
      Target -->
