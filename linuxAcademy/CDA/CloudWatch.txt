CloudWatch --> used to monitor AWS services , like S3, EC2, ELB by configuring cloudWatch matrices
  for example: 
    EC2 per-instance metrices -->
      CPUUtilization
      CPUCreditUsage 
    S3 metrices -->
      NumberOfObjects
      BucketSizeBytes
    ELB metrices -->
      RequestCount
      UnhealthyHostCount

Monitoring levels -->
  Basic --> data will be available in every 5-min at no cost
  Detailed --> in every 1-min with some cost

CloudWatch Alarms --> 
  --> CloudWatch alarms can be configured to trigger alerts based on threshold set on cloudWatch metrics.
  --> Auto scaling of AWS heavily rely on cloudWatch threshould and alarms

CloudWatch Logs --> 
  --> centralized repository
  --> log streams (example: EC2 cloudwatch log agent)
  --> metrics can be made from log stream

CloudWatch Events -->
  --> create rules to respond to events in events stream: (trigger AWS lambda function when EC2 instance spin up/down)
  --> schedule events

CloudWatch EC2 monitoring -->
  --> System status check --> (things that are outside of our control)
        --> Loss of network connectivity/ loss of power
        --> software/hardware issues on physical hosts
        --> how to solve:- generally stopping/starting instance can solve the issue, because this cause an instance to launch on different physical hardware device. 
  --> instance status check --> (software issue that we do have some control)
        --> failed system status checks
        --> setup configuration issue or network configuration issue
        --> exhuasted memory
        --> corrupted filesystem
        --> incompatible Kernel
        --> How to solve: --> generally a reboot, or solving the file system configuration issue.

--> By default cloudWatch automatically monitor metrics that can be viewed at host level (not at software level):
  --> such as --> CPUUtilization, Network in/out, CPUCreditBalance, CPUCreditUsage

--> OS level metrics that required a third party script (perl) to be installed (provided by AWS)
    --> memory utilization, memory available, disk swap utilization, disk space available, disk space unitilization

CloudWatch agent --> enables you to do the following:
    --> Collect more system-level metrics from Amazon EC2 instances, including in-guest metrics, in addition to the metrics listed in Amazon EC2 Metrics and Dimensions. The additional metrics are listed in Metrics Collected by the CloudWatch Agent.
    --> Collect system-level metrics from on-premises servers. These can include servers in a hybrid environment as well as servers not managed by AWS.
    --> Collect logs from Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers, running either Linux or Windows Server.
    --> Retrieve custom metrics from your applications or services using the StatsD and collectd protocols. StatsD is supported on both Linux servers and servers running Windows Server. collectd is supported only on Linux servers.
