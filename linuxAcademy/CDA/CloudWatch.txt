CloudWatch --> used to monitor AWS services , like S3, EC2, ELB by configuring cloudWatch matrices
  for example: 
    EC2 per-instance metrices -->
      CPUUtilization
      CPUCreditUsage 
    S3 metrices -->
      NumberOfObjects
      BucketSizeBytes
    ELB metrices -->
      RequestCount
      UnhealthyHostCount
Monitoring levels -->
  Basic --> data will be available in every 5-min at no cost
  Detailed --> in every 1-min with some cost
CloudWatch alarms can be configured to trigger alerts.
Auto scaling of AWS heavily rely on cloudWatch threshould and alarms
