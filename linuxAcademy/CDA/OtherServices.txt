X-Ray --> traces request as they move through your application
  it can be useful to collect data, and view, filter, sort are few operations. Can be useful for optimization, etc
  
concepts and components -->
  segments --> contains data about the work done by your application
  subSegments --> a more granular view of data inside the segment
  serviceGraph --> JSON doc, contains info about how services and resources interacts
  Traces --> trace IDs tracks request as they go through in application
  Sampling --> X-Ray applies an algorithm to sample request data (high-volume or low-volume sampling)
  tacing header -->
  filter expression --> used to search through your traces
  annotations and metadata --> additional way to store searchable (annotation) and non-searchable (metadata) info 
  Errors (client error-400), faults (server fault-500) and expressions (too many request-429) --> to trace application error messages

CodeCommit --> manage, secure and scalable source code service to host private Git repository
  Benefits --> fully managed and secure AWS service
            collaborate on code, no limit on file type and size of repository
            easy intergration with other AWS services and other Git repository

CodeBuild --> fully managed build service that can compile source code, run unit test and produce deployment artifacts
  Benefits --> pre-configured env for many popular languages, high scalable
 components --> 
  Build Project --> define here rules how codeBuild should run the build (like, where is source code, what env, build commands, etc)
  Build Environment --> OS, language runtime, framework, tools specifications
  Build spec --> YAML file to describe collection of commands, settings used by CodeBuild to build the code

CodeDeploy --> automates deployment of your application to EC2, lambda, and even on on-premises env
  Benefits --> automate process, minimize downtime, easy stop and rollback, centralized management
  Deployment types --> 
    In-place deployment --> existing servers updated with new version of application
    Blue/Green Deployment (EC2) --> new application version to new instance, traffic re-route from old to new instance, 
        easy fall-back from new to old, incase of issues
    Blue/Green Deployment (Lambda) --> same as EC2 for old to new version, but can be done in multiple ways 
      Canary --> a percentage of traffic is shifted to new version
      Linear --> traffic is shifted in equal increments with an equal number of minutes between each increment
      All-at-Once --> immidiate and completely shifted to new version

CodeDeploy AppSpec File --> mention details about how to deploy applications
  LifeCycle Hooks --> allows scripts to run during deployment
    BeforeInstall, AfterInstall, ApplicationStart, ApplicationStop, validateService

CodePipeline --> continuous delivery service that can model, visualize, and automate your software release process.
  Benefits --> 
      automate release process -- source repo through build, test and deploy
      consistent release process - set of steps for every new changes
      Real-time status of process
  Components --> 
    pipeline --> workflow that describes how changes go through release process
    artifacts --> files or changes that will be worked on by actions and stages
    stages --> different stages, like build, deployment (same like phases)
    actions --> stages contains atleast one action, these action applied to artifacts to move as input or output for the process
    transition --> progressing from one stage to another inside of pipeline
    
CodeStar --> service for creating, managing, and working with AWS projects
  CodeStar well integrates with CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, CodeCommit, codeBuild, CloudWatch
  Benefits --> 
    can create templates for projects and reuse them
    Helps manage users and access to project (saves some complecation of IAM policies)
    visualize activity on your projects
