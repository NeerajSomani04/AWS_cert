CodeDeploy --> automates deployment of your application to EC2, lambda, and even on on-premises env
    means, even you can schedule your deployment and everything will start automatically at scheduled time.
    --> Specify your instances, and then deploy your application from Amazon S3 or GitHub or codeCommit.
    --> CodeDeploy can use cloudFormation to support its deployment for AWS resources.
  Benefits --> automate process, minimize downtime, easy stop and rollback, centralized management
  Deployment types --> 
    In-place deployment --> existing servers updated with new version of application
    Blue/Green Deployment (EC2) --> new application version to new instance, traffic re-route from old to new instance, 
        easy fall-back from new to old, incase of issues
    Blue/Green Deployment (Lambda) --> same as EC2 for old to new version, but can be done in multiple ways 
      Canary --> a percentage of traffic is shifted to new version
      Linear --> traffic is shifted in equal increments with an equal number of minutes between each increment
      All-at-Once --> immidiate and completely shifted to new version

notes for Blue/Green deployment ** After instances in the replacement environment are registered with a load balancer, instances from the original environment are deregistered and can be terminated.

CodeDeploy AppSpec File --> mention details about how to deploy applications, sequencial order of steps needs to follow by codeDeploy
    Below is the LifeCycle Hooks applicable when there is no CLB to balance the load
    --> Start, ApplicationStop, DownloadBundle, BeforeInstall, Install, AfterInstall, ApplicationStart, ValidateService, END (LifeCycle Hooks)
      Lambda Deployment --> which function to use, which function can do validation test
      EC2 or On-premises deployment --> what to install, from where to fetch objects, what lifecycle of events occur
      
  LifeCycle Hooks --> allows scripts to run during deployment step, depending upon deployment type/environment
    --> Start, ApplicationStop, DownloadBundle, BeforeInstall, Install, AfterInstall, ApplicationStart, ValidateService, END
