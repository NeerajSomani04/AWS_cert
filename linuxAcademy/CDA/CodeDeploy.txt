CodeDeploy --> automates deployment of your application to EC2, lambda, and even on on-premises env
    means, even you can schedule your deployment and everything will start automatically at scheduled time.
  Benefits --> automate process, minimize downtime, easy stop and rollback, centralized management
  Deployment types --> 
    In-place deployment --> existing servers updated with new version of application
    Blue/Green Deployment (EC2) --> new application version to new instance, traffic re-route from old to new instance, 
        easy fall-back from new to old, incase of issues
    Blue/Green Deployment (Lambda) --> same as EC2 for old to new version, but can be done in multiple ways 
      Canary --> a percentage of traffic is shifted to new version
      Linear --> traffic is shifted in equal increments with an equal number of minutes between each increment
      All-at-Once --> immidiate and completely shifted to new version

CodeDeploy AppSpec File --> mention details about how to deploy applications
      Lambda Deployment --> which function to use, which function can do validation test
      EC2 or On-premises deployment --> what to install, from where to fetch objects, what lifecycle of events occur
      
  LifeCycle Hooks --> allows scripts to run during deployment step, depending upon deployment type/environment
    BeforeInstall, AfterInstall, ApplicationStart, ApplicationStop, validateService
