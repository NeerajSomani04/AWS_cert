ELB and Session state --> (EC2 and ELB good combination for Serverless RestFul APIs)
  Load Balancing --> means distributing incoming traffic across servers
  ELB can distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances across multiple AZs
  --> ELB provides access logs that capture detailed information about requests sent to your load balancer. 
  ELB can maintain session state -->
    option 1 --> ELB generated cookies stickiness (this will sent traffic from same request to same instance everytime) 
    option 2 --> application generated cookies stickiness (additional code management headache)
    Non-ELB option --> Highly recommended, Use caching services like AWS ElasticCache
Types of ELB -->
  Classic Load balancer --> old but for http/https/tcp requests (No granular routing rules)
  Application Load Balancer ---> for http and https requests
            content based rules --> (setup on listener)
            Host-based rules --> route traffic based on the host field of HTTP header
            Path-based rules --> route traffic based on URL path of HTTP header
            priority rules --> 
            --> this allows you to structure your application as small services
            --> even monitor and auto-scale based on traffic to "specific groups"
            --> can balance traffic to multiple ports
       --> ALB also supports ECS, EKS, HTTPs, HTTP/2, Web Socket, Access Logs, WAF, 
       ALB with ECS service -->
          --> ALB allow containers to use dynamic host port mapping (so that multiple tasks from the same service are allowed per container instance).
          --> ALB support path-based routing and priority rules (so that multiple services can use the same listener port on single ALB).
 
 Network load balancer --> for TCP requests (Reliability Pillar)
        --> NLB is designed for extreme performance. No need to scale to handle large traffic
        --> Layer 4 (TCP) load balancing
        --> Static / Elastic IP address per AZ
        --> IP addresses as Targets
        --> No SSL offloading
