Troubleshooting --> 
1. EC2 Troubleshooting --> 
--> connectivity issues to an EC2 instance --> correct port on security group may not be open
--> Can not attach an EBS volume to an EC2 instance --> 
    --> EBS volume and EC2 instance must be in same AZ
    --> you can create a snapshot from the volume and launch the volume in correct AZ
--> can't launch additional instances --> you probably reach the limit, contact AWS support
--> Unable to download package updates --> EC2 instance may not have public/Elastic IP and or doesn't belong to public subnet
--> Applications seeming to slow down on T2 micro instances --> 
    --> T2 micro instances utilize CPU credit (for "bustable" processing), so chances are your application using to much processing power, so needs a larger instance or different instance type
--> AMI unavailable in other regions --> 
        ---> AMIs are only available in the region in which they are created    
        --> AMI can be copied to another region but will received a new AMI ID
--> "Capacity error" when attempting to launch an instance in a placement group
        --> start and stop all the instances in a placement group (AWS try to locate them as close as possible)

2. VPC Troubleshooting -->
    --> New EC2 instances are not automatically being assigned public IP address
            --> modify the auto assign public IP setting on the subnet
    --> NAT Gateway is configured but instances inside a private subnet still can't download packages -->
            --> need to add 0.0.0.0/0 route to the NAT gateway on the route table of the private subnet 
    --> Traffic is not making it in to the instances even though security groups are correct
            --> check the NACL to ensure the proper ports from the proper sources are open (also check your IGW and route table settings)
    --> Error when attempting to attach multiple internet gateways (IGW) to a VPC
            --> only one internet gateway can be attach to a VPC at any given time
     --> Error when attempting to attach multiple virtual private gateway (VPG) to a VPC
            --> only one VPG can be attach to a VPC at any given time
     --> VPC security groups (for EC2 instance) doesn't have enough rules for the required application
            --> assign the EC2 instance to multiple security groups
     --> Can't SSH/communicate with resources inside of a private subnet
            --> Either you have not setup a VPN or you have not connected to an EC2 instance (Bastion Host) within the VPC to launch a connection from.
    --> Successful site-to-site VPN connection but unable to access extended resources
            --> need to add on-premise routes to the VPG route table
    --> Failure to create a VPC peering connection between two VPC's in different regions
            --> Peering connections can only be created between two VPC in the same region
 
 3. ELB Troubleshooting --> 
    --> Load balancing is not occuring between instances in multi-AZs
        --> make sure "enable cross zone load balancing" has been selected
    --> Instances are healthy but are not registering as healthy with the ELB
        --> check configuration for "health check", make sure you have selected the proper ping protocol, ping port and ping path
    --> The ELB is configured to listen on port 80, but traffic is not making it to instances that belong to ELB
        --> you may have mistaken the "Listeners" for the security group. Listeners are not the same as security group rules, port 80 still need to be open on security group that the ELB is using.
    --> Access logs on web server show IP addresses of the ELB not the source traffic
        --> Enable access logs to Amazon S3 (found under attributes)
    --> Unable to add instances from a specific subnet to the ELB
        --> most likely the subnet that the instance lives in has not been added to the ELBs configuration

4. Auto Scaling Troublshooting -->
    --> An auto scaled instance continous to start/stop (or create/terminate) in short intervals
        --> the scale up and scale down threasholds may be too close to each other. Either raise the scale-up threshold or scale-down the threshold.
    --> Auto scaling does not occur even though scaling policies are configured correctly.
        --> the max number of instances set in the auto scaling group may have been reached.
     
 ** few other troubleshooting scenarios will be covered in SysOps course as they are not needed for CDA or CSA.
 
5. Troubleshooting Amazon S3 --> 
    Symptoms --> 
       1. --> Significant Increases in HTTP 503 Responses to Requests to Buckets with Versioning Enabled
            --> this usually comes for PUT or DELETE requests
            --> this occurs When you have objects with millions of versions
S3 Inventory tool --> To determine which S3 objects have millions of versions, use the Amazon S3 inventory tool. The inventory tool generates a report that provides a flat file list of the objects in a bucket.
            --> S3 team encourages customers to investigate applications that repeatedly overwrite the same S3 object

       2. --> Unexpected Behavior When Accessing Buckets Set with CORS
            --> Verify that the CORS configuration is set on the bucket.
            --> Capture the complete request and response using a tool of your choice. 
                --> Verify that the request has the Origin header.
                --> Verify that the Origin header in your request matches at least one of the AllowedOrigin elements in the specified CORSRule.
                --> Verify that the method in your request (or in a preflight request, the method specified in the Access-Control-Request-Method) is one of the AllowedMethod elements in the same CORSRule.
                --> For a preflight request, if the request includes an Access-Control-Request-Headers header, verify that the CORSRule includes the AllowedHeader entries for each value in the Access-Control-Request-Headers header.
