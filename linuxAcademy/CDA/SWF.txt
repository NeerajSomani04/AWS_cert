SWF Essentials --> fully managed workflow service
  allows application team to implement distributed and asynchronous application.
  coordinates and manages the execution of activities
  SWF guarantees the order of activity, consistent and continous execution
  SWF cant have duplicate tasks
  A workflow execution time can be mins to 1 year
 
 Components of SWF -->
  workflows (decider) --> sequence of steps to perform a specific tasks
  Activities --> A single step of workflow
  tasks --> that interacts with workers
    2 types -->
      active tasks --> tells a worker to perform a function
      decision tasks --> tells the decider about state of the workflow execution
  workers --> responsible for receiving a tasks and take action on it
  
SWF vs SQS -->
  similarities --> both used to create dictirbuted systems and to scale each task independently
  Differnece --> SWF can have human interacted task as part of workflow
      SQS max life 14 days vs SWF workflows and tasks life upto 1 year

SWF and Step Function -->
  Similarities --> Both can help create coordination between application components
  Difference --> SWF uses a decider program, not a JSON defined state machine, to make decisions
    SWF doesn't have a visual workflow of step functions
    SWF gives complete control over organizing tasks but adds more complexity.
