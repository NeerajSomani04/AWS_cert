SWF Essentials --> fully managed workflow service
  allows application team to implement distributed and asynchronous application.
  coordinates and manages the execution of activities
  SWF guarantees the order of activity, consistent and continous execution
  SWF can't have duplicate tasks
  A workflow execution time can be few mins to 1 year
  --> Its an API service that can be used by non-AWS services as well, like on-premises components to integrate and manage their workflow tasks.
 
 Components of SWF -->
  starter --> starts the workflow
  workflows (decider) --> sequence of steps to perform a specific tasks
      --> decider is a program code (in any programming language) that cooridates the execution across worker process
  Activities --> A single step (or unit of work) in the workflow
  tasks --> that interacts with workers that are part of workflow
    2 types -->
     activity tasks --> tells a worker to perform a function (eg: to encode video, check inventory, etc)
     decision tasks --> tells the decider about state of the workflow execution, which allows the decider to determine about next activity
  workers --> responsible for receiving a tasks and take action on it. it can be any type means, a EC2 instance or a person
  
  
SWF vs SQS -->
  similarities --> both used to create dictirbuted systems and allow to scale each task independently
  Difference --> SWF can have human interacted task as part of workflow but not in SQS
      SQS max life 14 days vs SWF workflows and tasks life can be upto 1 year

SWF and Step Function -->
  Similarities --> Both can help create coordination between application components
  Difference --> SWF uses a decider program, not a JSON defined state machine, to make decisions
    SWF doesn't have a visual workflow of step functions
    SWF gives complete control over organizing tasks but adds more complexity.
