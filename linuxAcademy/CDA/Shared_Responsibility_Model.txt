Shared Responsibility Model --> 
 Security and Compliance is shared responsibility between AWS and customers.
 
AWS responsible for --> "Security OF the Cloud"
--> setup and maintainance of physical harware located at each AWS data center
--> physical security of data centers (locks, keys, security guards)
--> setup and maintainance of host virtualization software / infrastructure
--> Storage Decommision
--> Network Infrastructure
 
 Customer responsible for --> "Security IN the cloud"
 --> Network level security (NACL, security groups)
 --> OS patches and updates
 --> IAM (user access management)
 --> client and server side data encryption (Data in-trasit, Data at-rest)
 --> AMIs
 --> Applications
 --> Firewall
 --> Intrusion detection
 --> Intrusion prevention
 
 
 Shared Responsibility Model -->
  AWS Responsibility -->
  >> Physical server level and below
  >> physical env security and protection (firewall/power/climate/management)
  >> storage device decomissioning as per industry standards
  >> personnel security
  >> Network Device security and ACL
  >> AWS API endpoints - SSL
  >> DDOS protection
  >> EC2 instances and spoofing protection (Ingress / Egress filtering)
  >> EC2 instances hypervisor isolation (instances on the same physical device are still independent, shared physical device between instances)
  
  Customer Responsibility -->
  >> IAM
  >> MFA
  >> Password/ Key Rotation
  >> Access Advisor
  >> Trusted Advisor
  >> security groups
  >> Resource based policies
  >> ACL
  >> VPC
  >> Port scanning is against the rules even on your own environment (ask AWS if needed)
  >> OS level patches

Amazon does not vouch for the integrity or security of AMIs shared by other Amazon EC2 users. Therefore, you should treat shared AMIs as you would any foreign code that you might consider deploying in your own data center and perform the appropriate due diligence. We recommend that you get an AMI from a trusted source


Some responsibility differs based on services -->
  AWS Lambda -->  Generally, OS patches are customer responsibilty
      Although, AWS Lambda is fully-managed service that lets AWS handle responsibility for OS operations as well.

AWS Compute Overview -->
  EC2 --> Virtual server based service
  Lambda --> Serverless based service
  ECS --> Elastic container based service
  Elastic BeanStalk --> PAAS

AWS Storage Overview -->
  S3 --> Object based stirage
  Glacier --> Archive object based storage
  DataBase services -->
    DynamoDB --> serverless NoSQL DB
    RDS --> mully-managed SQL DBs
    Elastic Cache --> In-memory Cache Engine
    Redshift --> PetaBytes managed DW
