Route 53 --> DNS service (Domain Name System service) - Domain Management Service
you can configure and manage web domains for websites you host on AWS.

3 main functions of AWS Route 53-->
  1. Domain Registration --> you can register domain name as per availability, such as example.com
  2. DNS service (Domain Name System service) --> Route53 translates friendly domain names into IP address.
        Route53 respond to DNS queries using a global network of authoritative DNS server which reduces latency.
        DNS Failover --> automatically change domain endpoint if system fails.
  3. Health Checking --> frequently send automated requests to make sure application health and accessibility.
  
you can use Route53 for either Domain Registrar or DNS Service or even both.

Some other functionality of Route53 -->
  --> Route53 can manage external DNS for domain routing
        --> means, routing request for external domain like google.com, to proper AWS resources such as CloudFront Distribution, ELB, EC2 instances, RDS server.
  --> Route53 is commonly used with ELB to direct traffic from the domain to the ELB (for evenly distribution of traffic)
  --> Route53 can also be used to manage internal DNS for custom internal hostnames within a VPC as long as VPC is configured for it.
  --> Latency, GEO, basic and failover routing policies allow for region-to-region fault tolerant architecture design.
  --> you can easily configure for failover to S3 (if website bucket hosting is enabled)
  

Route53 Hosted Zones -->
    --> A hosted zone stores DNS records for your domain
    --> Basically, it contains all the rules (record sets) that tells Route53 what to do with DNS request.
    --> After you created a hosted zone for your domain, you create resource record sets to tell the DNS how you want traffic to be routed for that domain.
    --> Hosted zone comes pre-populated with NS (name server) and SOA (start of authority) record sets.
 
 2 types of Hosted Zones -->
    --> Public Hosted Zones --> is a container that holds information about how you want to route traffic on the internet for a domain and its sub-domain.
    --> Private Hosted Zones --> is a container that holds information about how you want to route traffic for a domain and its sub-domain within one or more AWS VPCs.
   
Route53 Record Sets --> 
  --> Record sets are instructions that actually match domain names to IP addresses.
  --> Record sets are comprised of various options, including:
      --> Record Type
      --> Standard / Alias
      --> Routing policy
      --> Evaluate Target health
  --> Common record types include --> 
      A: used to point a domain to an IPv4 IP address
      AAAA: used to point a domain to an IPv6 IP address
      CNAME: Used to point host/name to another host/name
      MX: used to route email (mail exchange)
 
Alias Record sets -->
Routing policy -->
Evaluate Health Check -->
