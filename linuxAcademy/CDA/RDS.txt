RDS Essentials --> fully managed relational DB service (means, store data in tables)
  --> can't access underlying OS, because fully managed by AWS
  --> connecting to RDS is very similar to connecting to any other on-premises DB
  --> auto scaling can be enabled, highly available, multi-AZ, 
  --> can create Read replicas to distribute traffic from primary DB
  --> OLTP DB

Supported DBs -->
  MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server
  Aurora --> AWS home growned RDB, 
      --> fully compatible with MySQL or PostgreSQL
      --> has 5 times better performance than MySQL and 3 times better performance than PostgreSQL
      --> lower competitive prices
      Main Features --> 
        --> upto 15 read replicas across 3 AZs
        --> continous backups
        --> single-digit millisec replication lag
        --> Back-track in seconds
        --> multi-master option

benefits --> 
  automatic minor system updates
  automatic backups (point-in-time snapshots)
  no OS management / fully managed service
  multi-AZ on a single click
  auto recovery incase of failure.
  
RDS Read Replicas -->
  --> Asynchronous copies of primary database that are used for read-only purpose
  --> AWS automatically copy data to Replicas from primary, when any new write come to primany
  --> cross region read replicas are supported
  --> MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Aurora, currently support read replicas
  --> CloudWatch can be used to monitor lag

RDS Multi-AZ failover --> (stand-By DB instance)
  --> Multi-AZ failover (automatic AZ failover) synchronously replicates data to a back-up (stand-by) DB instance located in another AZ but in same region.
  --> This is helpful in the event of:
        --> service outage in an AZ
        --> Primary DB instance failure
        --> instance server type is changed
        --> Manual failover initiated
        --> Updating software version
        --> AWS will automatically switch the DNS record from primary instance to stand-by instance
        
   --> RDS backups are taken against the stand-by instance to reduce I/O freezes and slowdown if multi-AZ is enabled
   --> In-order for multi-AZ to work your primary DB instance must be launched into a subnet group
   
RDS Backups --> (Automated backups and snapshots)
    --> AWS provides automated point-in-time backups against RDS instance
    --> automated backups are deleted once the DB instance is deleted and it can't be recovered
    --> The max retention period for automated snapshot is 35 days.
    --> manual snapshots can be retained for as long as you want.
    --> snapshots can be copied to other regions for Disaster Recovery purposes
    --> RDS Encryptions enable --> snapshots are automatically encrypted
  
**** Notes from Udemy -->
Two requirements: 1. access to underlying EC2 instance to install OS level patches and 2. Need to use license that is tied to physical hardware. Inorder to install OS level patches, you need EC2 instance and to use licenses tied to hardware level, you need dedicated hosts.

**** With RDS, if you do not use a standby instance, the primary data is: located within a single availability zone

*** You are using a multi-AZ deployment with RDS and setup has a primary and standby instance. It will behave as:
  --> transactions may take longer time
  --> Standby is connected to Primary using synchronous replication. Any slowness in standby would impact primary
