CloudFront --> (CDN) --> Content Delivery network
    --> allows you to store (cache) your content at "edge locations" located all around the world.
    --> allows customer to access your content more quickly
    --> also provides additional security specially against DDOS attacks

CloudFront Essentials --> 
    --> CloudFront is a global CDN which delivers content to users from the nearest edge location.
    --> CloudFront retrieves content from origins.
    --> CloudFront Distribution (web or RTMP)
            --> Define origins for content (static or dynamic)
            --> cloudFront can integrate with Route53 for alternate "CNAMEs" --> (this allows you to create a URL such that it can work with your distribution)
            --> Cache behaviors (Path Patterens{images/*.jpg}, min/max/default TTL, Query string forwarding and caching, HTTP methods (GET/PUT/POST/HEAD/etc)

Updating Cached Files --> 
         --> Caching is done based off the cache key
         --> In order to serve a new version of an object, either create a new object with a new name or create an "invalidation" on the cloudFront distribution based off the object name.
         --> "Invalidation" can be costly.
         --> set TTL = 0
    

CloudFront Security --> 
    --> SSL certificates
    --> end-to-end https
    --> AWS WAF integration
    --> Distribute private content
            --> S3 (limited access to Origin Access Identity (OAI))
            --> Signed URL or Signed Cookie --> (Expiration, restrict by IP, Trusted Signers (CloudFront Key-pair))
    --> Geo Restriction
