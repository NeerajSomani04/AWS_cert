DynamoDB Overview -->
  Fully managed NoSQL DB
  consistent and fast performance
  easy to setup and communicate with
  optional encryption at rest

DynamoDB Pricing --> 
  provisioned throughput Writes (WCU - write capacity unit)
  Provisioned throughput Reads (RCU - Read capacity unit)
  Indexed data storage -- (secondary index)
  Other pricing factors --> 
    Resevred capacity, auto scaling, global tables, on-demand backup, on-demand restore, DynamoDB Accellerator (DAX), DynamoDB Streams

DynamoDB core concepts -->
  partition Key --> also known as HASH attribute, scalar in nature (means holds only one value), 
  sort key --> also known as Range attribute, not a required Key, scalar in nature, this is used to sort data in each partition
  primary key --> used to uniquely identify each item, must be of type string, number, or binary
    2 types --> simple primary key {only partition key}, composite primary key {partition key + sort key}
  Items --> group of attributes that can be uniquely indetifiable, (similar as row of RDBMS)
  attributes --> fundamental data element of dynamodb (same as individual column of RDBMS)
    data types supported --> 
      scalar type --> String, number, binary, boolean, null
      document type --> List, Map
      set --> number sets, string sets, binary sets

DynamoDb provision throughput --> Read and Write Capacity
  its maximum amount of capacity that application can consume, after that request are throttled
  throughput sets at table level, but split-up and consumed at partition level. Means, one partition can lack capacity but others are fine.
  Exam tips --> 
    seconds vs minutes vs hours - WCU and RCU are number of writes and reads per second. always calculate troughput per sec
    rounding --> round-up to nearest 1 KB (for WCU) and nearest 4 KB (for RCU)

DynamoDB Partitions --> partitions are SSD allocation of storage for tables, replicated across AZs.
  number of partition determines by provisioned capacity and storage size of partition
  
  Provisioned Capacity writes --> WCU consumed when creating, deleting, updating items
    1 WCU = 1 write of item of size 1 KB or less per second
   example:- how many WCU needed for a table to have 120 writes per min for each item of size 2.5 KB
   Answer:- WCU = 120 item/min * 2.5 KB = 120 item/60 sec * 3 KB (nearest 1 KB) = 6 WCU
 
 Atomic Counters --> DynamoDB writes applied in the order received, if operation fails they can be retried. This brings a risk of updating item twice, possibly under or overcounting.
 Hence, conditional writes are introduced.
