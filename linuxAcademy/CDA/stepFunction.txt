Step Function Essentials -->
  fully managed service to coordinate components of application, through each step. 
  its give various functionality that helps co-ordination of different components of distributed applications, 
      like workflow diagram, neviagtion tools, visualize application logic, serverless application orchestration,
  Highly-scalable, reliable, 
  
 Step function components --> 
    Tasks --> an activity or Lambda function, basic program code that interacts with step function APIs,
      like GetActivityTask, SendTaskSuccess, SendTaskFailure, sendTaskHeartBeat
    State Machines --> consist of tasks  {JSON doc with Amazon state language, and type of state}
    what is state types -->
      step function co-ordinate tasks through state-machine.
      Each 'state' in a state-machine makes decisions based on inputs, performs actions, and passes output to other state.
      'state' --> is a unique string name
      some other state types --> 
        'Tasks' --> states do some work in state machine
        choice --> states makes choices between different branches
        fail or succeed --> state stop execution of your machine incase of failure or success
        pass --> state pass there input to their output
        wait -->
        parallel -->
