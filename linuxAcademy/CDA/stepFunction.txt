Step Function Essentials -->
  fully managed service to coordinate components of application, through each step. 
  its give various functionality that helps co-ordination of different components of distributed applications, 
      like workflow diagram, neviagtion tools, visualize application logic, serverless application orchestration,
  Highly-scalable, reliable, 
  
 Step function components --> 
    Tasks --> an activity or Lambda function, basic program code that interacts with step function APIs,
      like GetActivityTask, SendTaskSuccess, SendTaskFailure, sendTaskHeartBeat
    State Machines --> consist of tasks  {JSON doc with Amazon state language, and type of state}
    what is state types -->
      step function co-ordinate tasks through state-machine.
      Each 'state' in a state-machine makes decisions based on inputs, performs actions, and passes output to other state.
      'state' --> is a unique string name
      some other state types --> 
        'Tasks' --> states do some work in state machine
        choice --> states makes choices between different branches
        fail or succeed --> state stop execution of your machine incase of failure or success
        pass --> state pass there input to their output and can inject some fixed data to the process
        wait --> states can delay the process for certain amount of time or date
        parallel --> states begins parallel execution of the state machine

Step Function transition -->
  basic transition -->
    when a state machine executes, it uses "startAt" field to select one of the state to begin
    "Next" field is the state for allowing next task in flow control
    flow continue until it reach terminal state with type: succeed, fail, or End: true

Step function API -->
  CreateStateMachine --> create a state machine, JSON document, consist of collection of states
  StartExecution --> start execution of state machine
  ListExecutions --> it list state machine execution, eventual consistent, means most recent state execution will display eventually
  StopExecution --> stop execution of state machine
