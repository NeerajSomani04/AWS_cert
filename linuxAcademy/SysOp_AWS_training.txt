Domain 1 -- Monitoring and alarms

1. CloudWatch -- metrics and alarms
perfomance metrics 
availability mterics
What are the remedies for this

CloudWatch --> AWS puts metric in repository and we can get metric based on repository
Features -> 
Metric --> time ordered set of data published to cloudwatch (Standard or custom)
Namespace: groups related metrics together
Dimension: name and value pair
Period: specific time during which metric collected
Alarm: automatically initiates when metric meets initial condtion
events and logs

*** Remember cloudWatch doesnot pull data. All services push data to cloudWatch.

you can enable detailed monitoring of EC2 from EC2 console and data will be pushed to cloudWatch for every 1 min period metric.

3 categories of alarms or triggers -->
OK --> threshold not exceed
Alarm --> threshold exceeded
Insufficient Data --> alarm has started but data not available. for example, you set up to collect data at every 5 min interval but for alarm you set up metric to trigger at every 1 min. then data is not sufficient.

Events are triggered in form of JSON file -->
Header part mostly same
Detailed part of JSON vary based on Event

CloudWatch logs --> collects logs from different services, apply filter and show in metric to trigger alarm or event

CloudTrail --> logs goes to S3, easily intergrate with cloudWatch for alarms

AWS config --> collect configuration history of services, when things changed, who changes configuration
