Well Architected Framework Summary -->
  5 pillars --> 
1. Security 
2. Reliability
3. Performance Efficiency
4. Cost Optimization
5. Oprational Excellence

1. Security --> 4 areas
  >> Data Protection 
        --> How encrypting data at rest
        --> how encrypting data at transit (SSL/TLS)
  >> Priviledge Management
        --> How are you protecting access to and use of AWS root account credentials
        --> How are you defining roles and responsibilities of system users to access AWS CLI/SDK or management consol
        --> How are you limiting automated access to AWS resources (like, by roles, etc)
        --> how are you managing keys and credentials
  >> Infrastructure Protection (around VPC)
        --> How are you enforcing network and host-level boundary protection
        --> how are you enforing AWS service level protection
        --> How are you protecting integrity of OS on EC2 instance.
  >> Detective Controls (around CloudTrail)
        --> How are you capturing and analyzing logs
  
2. Reliability ---> 3 area
    >> Foundation 
        --> How are you managing AWS service limits in AWS account
        --> How are you planning network topology on AWS
        --> Do you have any escalation path to deal with technical issues
    >> Change Management
        --> How does your system adapt to changes in demand
        --> How are you monitoring AWS resources
        --> How are you executing change management
    >> Failure Management
