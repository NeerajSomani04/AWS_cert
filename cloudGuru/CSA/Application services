Elastic Transcoder:-
    Amazon Elastic Transcoder lets you convert media files that you have stored in Amazon S3 into media files in the formats required 
    by consumer playback devices. For example, you can convert large, high-quality digital media files into formats that users can 
    play back on mobile devices, tablets, web browsers, and connected televisions.

Pricing --> based on minutes and resolution at which you transcode.

API Gateway -->
  Amazon API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, 
  including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management. Amazon API Gateway has no 
  minimum fees or startup costs. You pay only for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out.

API Gateway Caching --> 
  It basically cache response for few requestes that users are frequently accessing. This will gove low latency response to all users.
  Because, when first user make request --> API Gateway chache response of that request (only for few seconds {TTL} )
        ---> when second user makes same request --> API Gateway takes the cache response and deliver to user quickly as it doesn't 
            have to make request call again.
            
API Gateways Benefits -->
1. Low cost and efficient
2. Scale effortlessly
3. user can Throttle request to prevent attacks
4. Connect to cloudWatch to log all requests

Same Origin Policy --> 
    Web browser permits scripts contained in first webpage to access data in second web page, but only if both webpages have same origin.
    This is known as same origin policy.

Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CROS) -->
    CROS is one way -->  the server can relax the same origin policy.
    
    CORS is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the original domain.
    
    Error --> "Origin policy can't be read at remote resource"
    Solution --> You need to enable CORS at API Gateway.

Kinesis 101 -->
  Streaming Data --> It is continously generated data in/by applications in small size (i.e, in KBs), through thousands of data resources 
      at same time.
  Kinesis --> AWS service for easily load and analyze streaming data.
  3 category of Kinesis service -->
    1. Kinesis stream
    2. K Firehose
    3. K Analytics
  1. Kinesis Stream -->
      All incoming data are stored in multiple Shard for default 24 hours (and can be increased to 7 days) --> Data retention period
      Shards --> high read/write throughput with distributed environment
  2. Kinesis Firehose -->
      Its more automated way of Kinesis Streams.
      >> In this we don't need to manage shards 
      >> data in automaticaly stored to S3 after processing. Consumer services can access from S3 anytime
      >> you can't directly send data to RedShift or RDS or DynamoDB, it has to go to S3 first then to any other services.
      >> Firehose can send data directly to S3, ESC (ElasticSearch Cluster)
  3. Kinesis Analytics -->
      >> Allows user to write SQLs and analyze data that exists in FireHose or Stream.
 
 CloudFormation -->
    Allows user to quickly and easily deploy infrastructure resources and applications on AWS.
    Users can also use templates for few famous applications like wordPress, Drupal
