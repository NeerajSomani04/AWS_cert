Pocess of elimination is most important
Exam question wil test you on which AWS services works well together and which services don't.
Need to undersnatd it very well
Validating an answer with question is also important. (for example, is question asking about cost optimization, High Availability)
when you have to choose combination of options, need to check for patterens.

below is one way to solve any exam question:
1. Understand --> what exact question is all about, "kicker", 
2. Eliminate --> any conflict with question or fake information needs to be eliminated.
3. Evaluate --> think about all aspects of the question, in all dimensions generally and then evaluate each option.
4. Choose --> select best suited option/s, 
5. Validate --> verify again that our elimination and select best satify all the aspects of question.

1. Its good idea to take AWS official practice exam 7-10 days near your actual exam date.
Remember to take screen shot of every question with your answer for further analysis. (for max, command + shift + 3)
take screen shot of overview page before submitting

2. Also, can take acloud.guru final exam also around 7-10 days before your actual exam date to validate your knowledge.
  Repeat this many times untill you consistently get 100% score in all of your exam.
  Remember not to memories the question but to understand the question/answer.
