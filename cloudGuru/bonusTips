Learning effectively and style:-

1. study in small chunks. utilize sometime after each chunks just to review whatever you have learned earlier 
      and take a break of atlest 30-40 min.
    >> above will give brain sometime to absorb things and for your to recall what you have just learned.
    >> 2 hour effective learning (30 min each chunk) is more than enough to learn.
    >> if you have more time, revise your leanring. or do things in different ways. (point 2)
2. frequently change tasks and topics, corelated topics. This will help you to incorporating and reinforcing previously learned topics.
    >> this will help you to build your mental model
    >> strengthen and refine mental model
3. Revisite all topics together in one shot once you complete few topics. (Review, revisit, repetition will help mental model)
4. Spend little time in learning not learning as task (just after you wake-up, before you go to bed, bus stop, etc)
5. Need to understand few questions:
    >> what?? , HOW??, WHO??, Where??, Limits??
6. Need to prepare 30 seconds summary of each topics:
    >> Key strengths 
    >> Key weaknesses
    >> How it interacts
    >> limitations
    >> optimizations
7. PDCA -->
    >> Plan --> plan your learning path
    >> Do --> do what you planned 
    >> Check --> check how well that plan worked
    >> Adjust --> 
          a. Adjust your plan for future learning
          b. emphasizing techniques what worked well
          c. Validate (act) on what you have learned to get better (keep improving)
