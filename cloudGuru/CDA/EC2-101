Part 1 -->
1. EC2 Pricing model --> 
  On Demand --> By the second for linux and by the hour for Windows
  Reserved 
  Spot --> 
    > If you terminate the instance you will pay for the hour
    > If AWS terminate the instance because spot price goes above the bid price, then you get the hour it was terminated in for free.
  
  Dedicated Hosts
  
2. Different EC2 Instance types:-
DR Mc GIFT PX 

Exam Q: In given scenario which EC2 instance would you choose.
A: Need to understand "{DR Mc GIFT PX}" .

Part 2 --> EBS (Elastic Block Size) 
Think of it as Disk on top of CPU. 

It allows you to create storage volume and attach that to EC2 instances.
Below are different activities that you can perform on these volumes:
1. you can create your own file systems
2. run DB
3. etc... any other way you can use block size

EBS are usually placed in AZ and replication and security is guruantied.

EBS Volume Types:
1. General Purpose SSD (GP2) 
    > balance in price and performance
    > upto 10000 IOPS
    
2. Provisioned IOPs SSD (IO1)
    > designed for I/O intensive applications such as large RDBMS, NoSQL
    > more than 10000 IOPS (upto 20000)
    
Magnetic storage Volume
3. Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1)
    > Big Data
    > Data Warehouse
    > Log Processing
    > They cant be bootable
    > sequnential read/write
    > frequently accesss workload

4. Cold HDD (SC1)
    > Low cost storage
    > file server 
    > They cant be bootable
    
5. Magnetic (Standard)
    > lowest cost volumes that is bootable
    
** V V Important:
  > you can not mount one EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances, instead use EFS.
  

Some important points to remember:
1. subnet = 1. availability zone
