Part 1 -->
1. EC2 Pricing model --> 
  On Demand --> By the second for linux and by the hour for Windows
  Reserved 
  Spot --> 
    > If you terminate the instance you will pay for the hour
    > If AWS terminate the instance because spot price goes above the bid price, then you get the hour it was terminated in for free.
  
  Dedicated Hosts
  
2. Different EC2 Instance types:-
DR Mc GIFT PX 

Exam Q: In given scenario which EC2 instance would you choose.
A: Need to understand "{DR Mc GIFT PX}" .

Part 2 --> EBS (Elastic Block Size) 
Think of it as Disk on top of CPU. 

It allows you to create storage volume and attach that to EC2 instances.
Below are different activities that you can perform on these volumes:
1. you can create your own file systems
2. run DB
3. etc... any other way you can use block size

EBS are usually placed in AZ and replication and security is guruantied.

EBS Volume Types:
1. General Purpose SSD (GP2) 
    > balance in price and performance
    > upto 10000 IOPS
    
2. Provisioned IOPs SSD (IO1)
    > designed for I/O intensive applications such as large RDBMS, NoSQL
    > more than 10000 IOPS (upto 20000)
    
Magnetic storage Volume
3. Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1)
    > Big Data
    > Data Warehouse
    > Log Processing
    > They cant be bootable
    > sequnential read/write
    > frequently accesss workload

4. Cold HDD (SC1)
    > Low cost storage
    > file server 
    > They cant be bootable
    
5. Magnetic (Standard)
    > lowest cost volumes that is bootable
    
** V V Important:
  > you can not mount one EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances, instead use EFS.
  

Some important points to remember:
1. subnet = 1. availability zone

Q: what happenes to EBS volume attached to EC2 instance when you terminate the instance?
A: By default it will delete the volume.

Q: What is Volume in EBS?
A: Volume is Disk (SSD or HDD) where we perform different type of storage operations.

Q: What are security groups in EC2?
A: Its a virtual firewall. 

While launching EC2 instances we need to know about two important keys.
1. public key: that is stored in AWS
2. private key: that is stored by individual user. There should be only one private key per user for specific EC2 instances.

Task: Need to perform EC2 Lab and access EC2 instance through terminal. 
Below is the link provided by acloud guru to do the same. but I can find in oniline as well.
Also, need to undertsnad how to terminate any running EC2 instances. 

https://help.acloud.guru/hc/en-us/articles/115001389874-SSH-on-Linux-syntax-passphrases-
Below command looks like this:
ssh ec2-user@public-Key -i private-key-file
Below is the actual commands:--
ssh ec2-user@##.##.##.## -i my-key-pair.pem 
   or 
sudo ssh ec2-user@##.##.##.## -i my-key-pair.pem 
   or
sudo ssh ec2-user@##.##.##.## -i  /path/my-key-pair.pem 

Difference between system Status check vs Instance Status check
1. System status check: This is to check that instance is reachable and packages are deliving to instances.
2. Instance Status check: this is to check that operating system installed on that instance (server) accepting traffic.

We cant decrypt the default volume provided by EC2 instances.

Summary so far:
1. By default EC2 instance terminate option is disabled. Need to check that box to enable it.
2. Root volume (default) of EC2 instance can't be encrypted directly. means, EBS Root volume of your default AMI's cant be encrypted.
      For windows need to use third party tools or need to make a copy of the EC2 instance using AMI and encrypt it.
3. Any other added additional volumes can be encrypted.
4. On an EBS backed instance, the default action for the root volume to be deleted when instance terminated.

Security Groups:
This is place where we define what are the ports, and service call that we allow AWS to accept. 

CLI commands:
1. to login to AWS using terminal
ssh ec2-user@public-key -i private-key-file

2. sudo su --> only if you want to update anything to instances 
yum update -y    <--  then run this command
above command basically updating kernel with all security patches, 

3. yup install httpd -y
above command install apache on EC2 instance. We dont need to do this every time. its just first time when we create new EC2 instance.

4. service https start
above command will start the apache service.

5. chkconfig httpd on
above command will make sure to launch and install apache everytime we start EC2 or reboot EC2.

6. cd var/www/http
this is directory where everything is publically accessible. So for example if we create a website and keep all our pages here. 
That website is then publically accessible.

nano index.html
Above command will create an "index.html" text file, as nano is a text editor api and the type below line into file

<html><h1>Hello Cloud Gurus!</h1></html>

then hit ctrl+x then enter, then yes hit enter.

7. open web browser, place your public ip address and you will be able to see your webpage.

imp points to remeber about security groups:
1. Any update or changes happen to security group, apply or affect immidiately.
2. Any rule that you apply to inbound automatically apply to outbound. This is called stateFul.
    Hence, security groups are STATEFUL.
    But Newtork Access Control Groups are STATELESS, this will be covered in VPC section.
3. By default, all inbound traffic is denied, but all outbound traffic is allowed. 
     But we specifically mention in our security rule, what are the traffics that we allow for inbound. 
     We can't specify which one (ip address or protocol) to deny in our rules.
4. you can have any number of EC2 instances within a security groups.
5. you can have multiple security groups attached to an EC2 instances.
6. If you can't block any specific IP addresses using security groups then use Newtork Access Control lists.
7. you can specify allow rules but not deny rules.


Volumes and Snapshots:
Volumes exsits on EBS, and its a virtual hard disk.
Snapshots: exists on S3. Its nothing but point in time copy of Volumes.
Snapshots are incremental means, next time when you take snapshot it will copy only blocks of volume that has chnaged.

Recommendation for snapshot:
Stop the instance before taking snapshot. However, you can do it without stoping the EC2 instance as well.

Points to remember:
1. you can create AMI's from both volumes and snaps.
2. you can change volume size and storage type on the fly, while making copy.
3. Volume should always be in same AZ where EC2 instance is.
4. To move one EC2 instance from one AZ/Region to another, need to create snap or AMI, then copy it to new AZ/Region.

Volumes and Snapshots security --
1. snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically.
2. volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are also encrypted automatically.
3. you can share snapshots but only if they are unencrypted. These can be shared as public or with other AWS accounts.

Elastic File system:
EFS is a file service for EC2, its a block based service. Its elastic in nature mean, you can add or remove files to add or shrink storage.
Features:
1. Supports the Network file system version (NFSv4) protocol
2. you only pay for the storage you use.
3. can scale upto the petabytes.
4. can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections 
5. data is stored across multiple AZs within a region
6. read after write consistency

Multiple EC2 instances connecting to same EFS and accessing same files. EFS is basically storing files centrally.
you can provide access level restrictions to directory and file level.
Hence, Multiple EC2 can connect to one EFS but one EC2 can connect to only one EBS.

AWS CLI using credentials:
on terminal --> ssh ec2-user@public-key -i private-key-file
> sudo su 

once you are in you can use below aws commands to work on different aws services:
1. aws configure
  AWS Access Key ID: from csv file / screen shot that you took
  AWS secrete Access Key: from csv file / screen shot that you took
  Default region Name: provide region that you want
  Default Output format: leave blank and hit enter

2. aws s3 ls --> this command will give list of all buckets 
3. aws s3 help --> this will provide list of commands
4. to check where credentials are stored:
  1. cd ~  to go to home directory
  2. cd .aws --> this is hidden file directory
  3. ls
  4. 
  
5. aws ec2 describe-instances --> will list all available EC2 instnaces.
6. aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-03f709gjh79
above command is used to terminate EC2 instance. where "i-03f709gjh79" is intance id that you can get from EC2 instance describe command.
7. aws ec2 describe-images --> all AMI's created by user
8. aws run instances --> to create or run instances
9. aws start instances --instance-ids i-03f709gjh79 --> to start already created instances
10. aws stop instances --instance-ids i-03f709gjh79 --> to stop already created instances

EC2 instances Bash scripting:
1. These are the scripts that run when you initially launch or start your EC2 instance.
2. we can put these commands in the EC2 instance, configuration window, under advance settings.
3. 

Lambda -- its a event driven compute service
Q: what are the currently available blueprints or integrations that can trigger the Lambda function.
A: API Gateway, CloudWatch, CloudFront, AWS IOT, etc...

Imp Poimts:
Every time user sends any request that triggers lambda function, you are going to trigger a new lambda function.

Q: What are the different languages that are supported by Lambda?
A: Java, Python, Node.js, C#

Q: How Lambda is priced?
A: 
Number of requests:-- first 20 million requests are free. After that 20 cents per 1 million requests.
Duration of function run:-- duration calculation is start of the execution of function till the function returns or terminates 
      rounded upto 100 ms, and amount of memory you used during function run. The maximum run time for Lambda function is 5 min.

Lambda Exam Tips:-
1. Lambda scales out (not up) automatically.
2. Lambda functions are independent, 1 event = 1 function
3. Lambda functions can trigger other lambda functions, 1 event can = X lambda functions if functions trigger other functions
4. Lambda is serverless. Its good to know what services are serverless in AWS, like DynamorDB, API Gateway, etc.
5. AWS X-Ray service, can allow you to debug code what is happening. Very helpful incase of Architecture gets complicated.
6. Lambda can operate globally, you can do things like back-up of S3 bucket to another bucket
7. its good to know what services can triggers Lambda functions.

lecture --> EC2 Instance metadata and user data
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html

In this link we will see how to get EC2 instance public IP address through CLI, while we already login to EC2 instance through CLI.
>> curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data

above command will give us details about different directory related to EC2 instance.

>> curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4

above command will provide public ip-address of EC2 instance.

Q: How you will get public-ip address while you logedin to EC2 through CLI.
A: you need to look to meta-data of EC2 using above command and not the user-data.

Elastic Load Balancer -- 
Its a service that spreads the load of traffic, across different webservice.

Instances monitored by ELB are reported as: InService or OutOfService
Need to understnad the Health Check and Unhealty check
ELB has there own DNS name; you will never be given an IP address for ELB 
ELB FAQ is imp for exam.
