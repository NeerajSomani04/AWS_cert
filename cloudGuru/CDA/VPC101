VPC --> 
  >> virtual Data center on cloud.
  >> consist of IGW (internet Gateways or virtual private gateways), route tables, Network access control lists, subnets, security groups.
  
  1 subnet = 1 AZ
  Security groups are stateful --> means if Inbound is enabled, then outbound is also enabled
  Network Access control List stateless --> but here Inbound or Outbound needs to be enabled seperately


What are the things that we can configure in VPC:
1. Launch instances into a subnet of your choice
2. Assign custom IP address range in each subnet
3. configure route tables between subnets
4. create internet gateway and attach it to our VPC
5. Much better security control over your AWS resources
6. instance security groups
7. Subnet Network access control list (ACLS)

Difference between Default VPC vs Custom VPC
1. Default VPC allows you to directly attach EC2 instances and deploy.
2. Default VPC subnets are public in nature.
3. All EC2 instances has both public and private IP address.

VPC peering:-
in one VPC in one subnet in one EC2 instance --> communicate (using private IP add) ---> another VPC in another subnet in another EC2 instances
Instances behaves as they are in same private network.
VPC don't do transitive peering. Means one VPC commnicate to other only if they have direct link. not via some other VPC.
