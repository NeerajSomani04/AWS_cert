CloudFormation -->
  1. Control provision of resources as per need.
  2. By default "automatic rollback on error" is enabled. It provides either entire new changes or old, not partial/incomplete.
  3. "WaitCondition" parameter --> Stacks can wait based on this condition
  4. "fn:GetAtt" --> to retreive any output from stack

Cloud Formation Templates --> 
  
  
Intrinsic Function --> help to manage stacks. Helps to assign values available at runtime.
  Limitation --> Currently, Intrinsic Functions can only be used in resource properties, outputs, metadata attributes, and 
      update policy attributes. Can also be used to conditionally create stack resources.
