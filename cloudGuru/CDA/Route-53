1. DNS - 101
Domain Name Services: This is basically used to convert human friendly name (acloud.guru) into internet protocol Addresses (http://82.124.53.1)

IP address are the computer addresses in the internet world or in network.
commanly available IPs: 
IPv4 --> 32 bit field, around 4 billion different addresses
IPv6 --> 128 bits, around 340 undecillion different addresses

NS Records --> Name Server Records are used by Top Level Domain serversto direct the traffic to the content DNS server.
A record --> "A" stands for Address record, most fundamental type of DNS record. A Record translates the domain name to IP address.
TTL --> Time to Live for that domain at client machine cache, before it check at the server again.
CNAME --> canonical Name, is used to resolve one domain Name with another.
Alias Record --> allows you to resolve naked domain name (zone APEX address) to ELB's DNS address.
Naked Domain Name --> domain name that doesn't contain "www" or any other initial letters before it.

Important to remember --> 
1. ELB never uses IP addresses although it always uses Domain Name.
2. Difference between Alias record and CNAME
3. Always choose Alias record over CNAME.
  Answer --> why?? because Alias record are free, Alias record allows you to map Naked domain name with ELB's DNS name.
