Need to read CloudFormation FAQs for good understanding 

CloudFormation:- helps users to control complete provision of resources as per need.

1. CloudFormation is free but user pay for resources thats being provisioned.
2. By default "automatic rollback on error" is enabled. Mean, if due to any issue in JSON or somewhere is stack, 
    AWS will rollback compolete stack. it wouldn't provide half or incomplete stack. Although, there are charges for these error resources.
3. Stacks can wait for applications to be provisioned using the "WaitCondition" parameter.
4. "fn:GetAtt" this function is used to retreive any output from stack.
5. Route53 is completely supported, this includes creating new hosted zones or update existing one.
6. user can create A Records, alias, etc using cloudFormation.
7. IAM role creation and assignment is also support.

Need to understand the limitation , optimization of cloudFormation.
