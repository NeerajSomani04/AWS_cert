S3 (Simple storage Service)
Secure, durable, scalable, object storage.

Object based vs Block Based:
Object based: (S3) means storage for text files, photo files, video files, log files, etc.
Block Based: (EBS - Elastic Block Storage, volumes like HDD, SDD) This is mostly used for OS installation, DB Installation, etc.

S3 basic points to remember:
1. S3 stirage is object based
2. it allows to store files of size 0 bytes to 5 TB.
3. Storage is unlimited. 
4. S3 bucket is nothing but folders, S3 bucket name is globally unique. Means S3 bucket names shoudl be unique across all regions.
5. Whenever we create bucket, AWS creates a DNS for it, which looks like below:
https://s3-region-name.amazonaws.com/bucket_name
for example:-- https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru
6. Whenever S3 bucket file upload was successfull, user will receive 200 code as successful HTTP upload response.

Data Consistency model for S3:
1. Read after Write consistency for PUT request of new objects
2. Eventually consistent (can take upto few seconds to propogate) for overwrite PUTs and DELETEs. Means for any update or delete request.

Very very important::
Updates in S3 are atomic updates.
Atomic updates: means when ever you update anything on S3, you will either get new data or old data. 
      you will never get partially updated data.

S3 is simple Key, Value store
Key: Object Name
Value: Data, made up of sequence of bytes
