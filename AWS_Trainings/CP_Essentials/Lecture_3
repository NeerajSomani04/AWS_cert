AWS core services :- 

1. AWS Global Infrastructure:
    i) Regions: contains more than 2 or more AZ
      its geographyical location. 
      every region has differnt services.
      regions are complete seperate entities. Its not easy to move services from one region to another region.
    
      link for region based services:--> https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/
      
      1. optimize latency
      2. minimize cost
      
    ii) Availability zone: 
         collection of data centers within regions.
         every datacenter is isolated to one another but connected with vast low latency network.
    
    iii) Edge Location:
          host Content delivery network - CloudFront Service
          Deliver fast content to customers/end users
          they are also isolated 
          
          
2. AWS VPC (Virtual private cloud):
  A private virtual network on AWS
  Allows complete control of network configuration.
  offers several layers of security controls: complete control on incoming and outgoing traffic
  other security services deploy into VPC
 
 AWS VPC integrates well with AWS other services, like EC2, ELB, S3, EMR, RDS, etc
 
 Features of VPC:
 AWS VPC living within a Region, multiple VPC per account.
 One VPC defines one IP addresses --->  need to confirm this point
 VPC IP address then subdivide into "Subnet" which is used to divide VPC and allows it to span accross multiple AZs
 you have full control to create as many subnet as needed.
 same you can create as many route tables as needed to control the traffic.
 There are 2 types of subnet --> 
      i) public (direct access to internet) --> uses Internet Gateway (IGW)
      ii) private (no direct access to internet) --> uses NAT Gateway
 NACL (Network access control list) --> control access to subnet and stateless
 
 
3. Security Groups: we can create security groups and create roles witin it.
it filtern traffic and allows only from specific ports that you allowed in your roles defination.

4. compute services:
AWS EC2 instances: its nothing but servers, where we need to configure softwares (AMI - Amazon machine image), hardwares, networks, etc.
Need to set-up key pair file in-order to log-in to ec2 instanaces through terminal.

5. AWS Lambda:
Fully managed serverless compute
event driven execution
sub-second metering
multiple languages supported

6. AWS Elastic Beanstalk:
     Its a PaaS (platform as a service)
     It allows quick deployment of your application and reduces management complexity.
     Allows to control as per need
     support various security features
     support various languages
     
     Below are the components of Elastic Beanstalk: --
     Application service
     Http service
     operating system
     language interpreter
     host
