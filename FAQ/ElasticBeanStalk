  AWS Elastic Beanstalk vs existing application containers vs platform-as-a-service solutions 
  --> Most PAAS solutions, while reducing the amount of programming required, significantly diminish developersâ€™ flexibility and control. 
  --> However, with AWS Elastic Beanstalk, developers retain full control over the AWS resources powering their application.

EB - Databases and Storage --> 
  EB stores your application files and, optionally, server log files in Amazon S3.\
  By default, your application is available publicly.
  You can use VPCs network features to make it private.
  
  You can allow or deny permissions to specific AWS Elastic Beanstalk resources, such as applications, application versions, and environments.
  you can use IAM functionality to control over accessibility of application.
  
  you pay only for the AWS resources, no additional charges for EB.
