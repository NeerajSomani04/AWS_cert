** EBS Volume Types:
1. General Purpose SSD (GP2) --> solid state drive
    > balance in price and performance
    > upto 10000 IOPS
    
2. Provisioned IOPs SSD (IO1)
    > designed for I/O intensive applications such as large RDBMS, NoSQL
    > more than 10000 IOPS (upto 20000)
    
Magnetic storage Volume (Harddisk drive)
3. Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1) --> 
    > Big Data
    > Data Warehouse
    > Log Processing
    > They can't be bootable
    > sequnential read/write
    > frequently accesss workload

4. Cold HDD (SC1)
    > Low cost storage
    > file server 
    > They cant be bootable
    
5. Magnetic (Standard) --> same as cold but bootable
    > lowest cost volumes that is bootable


SSD-backed storage for transactional workloads (performance depends primarily on IOPS) -->
    designed for transactional, IOPS-intensive database workloads, boot volumes, and workloads that require high IOPS.
HDD-backed storage for throughput workloads (performance depends primarily on throughput, measured in MB/s)
    designed for throughput-intensive and big-data workloads, large I/O sizes, and sequential I/O patterns.


selected EC2 instance types as EBS-optimized instances --> 
    --> deliver dedicated throughput between Amazon EC2 and Amazon EBS between 62.5 MB/s and 1,750 MB/s
    --> can achieve single digit millisecond latencies

level of performance consistency --> 
(for any type of volume) IOPS rate you get depends on the I/O size of your application reads and writes
    Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volumes -->
        --> Every increase in I/O size above 256KB increases linearly the resources to achieve the same IOPS rate
        --> For example, provisioned volume with 500 IOPS, means it can handle up to 500 256KB writes per second, 250 512KB writes per second, or 125 1024KB writes per second, and so on
        performance impacted points for Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volumes -->
            --> new volumes created from a snapshot, without proper r/w capacity
            --> application isn’t sending enough I/O requests, This can be monitored by looking at your volume’s queue depth. 
                    The queue depth is the number of pending I/O requests from your application to your volume. 

     HDD-backed volumes -->
        --> HDD-backed volumes process reads and writes in I/O sizes of 1MB.
        --> Sequential I/Os are merged and processed as 1 MB units while each non-sequential I/O is processed as 1MB even if the actual I/O size is smaller. 
        performance impacted points for HDD-backed volumes -->
            --> relative imbalance between random and sequential I/O operations
            --> depending on the instance selected
            --> taking a snapshot which will decrease expected write performance
            --> application isn’t sending enough I/O requests, This can be monitored by looking at your volume’s queue depth. 

snapshots -->

snapshots are only available through the Amazon EC2 API.
snapshots can be done in real time while the volume is attached and in use.
    --> by using above snapshot will exclude unwritten data and cached data
Recommendataion, detaching the volume cleanly, issuing the snapshot even for root (which needs to be shutdown for the time)

Snapshots are not versioned, but they are considered as individual point-in-time copy.

Public Snapshots --> shared globally
Private Snapshots --> either you own it or someone shared with you who owns it

Encryption --> can be done at rest or in-transit
    --> using client-side or server-side encyption options
     AWS KMS --> managed service, to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data at rest.
            --> Your data and associated keys are encrypted using the industry-standard AES-256 algorithm.
            --> EBS encryption support boot volumes
