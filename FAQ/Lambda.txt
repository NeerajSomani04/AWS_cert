Lambda -->
    Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. (Zero administration on code)
    Lambda takes care of Auto scaling, high availability, etc. 
    Lambda makes it easy to execute code in response to events

Billing --> only for the time code is executing/running in environment and AWS resources used.

Serverless computing --> build and run applications and services without thinking about servers
                     --> server management is done by AWS.

Other services vs Lamda -->

Amazon EC2 --> for provisioning capacity, monitoring fleet health and performance, and designing for fault tolerance and scalability.
AWS Elastic Beanstalk --> offers an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications with full control over the underlying EC2 instances ownership. 
Amazon EC2 Container Service --> is a scalable management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run distributed applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.

AWS Lambda makes it easy to execute code in response to events, with no worry about provisioning AWS resources as per your need.

Few Points to know about Lambda -->
    you can't access the infrastructure that AWS Lambda runs on. Thats for AWS management.
    Lambda stores code in Amazon S3 and encrypts it at rest.
    code must be written in a “stateless” style i.e. it should assume there is no relationship to the underlying compute infrastructure.
    Lambda’s programming model is stateless, but your code can access stateful data from web services.
    Lambda must be stateless, so that it can rapidly launch as many copies of the function as needed to scale
    normal programming language and operating system features are allowed, like threads, processes, etc.

 few activities that are disabled for Lambda -->
    Inbound network connections are blocked 
    for outbound connections only TCP/IP sockets are supported, TCP port 25 traffic is also blocked as an anti-spam measure. 
    ptrace (debugging) system calls are blocked. 

Q: How are compute resources assigned to an AWS Lambda function?
Answer --> Users are allowed to choose memory and based on that AWS assign compute power to Lambda.
        You can set your memory in 64MB increments from 128MB to 3GB.

AWS Lambda to process AWS events -->

    The default timeout for Lambda is 3 seconds, you can reset between 1 and 300 seconds.
    Lambda support versioning, Clients who make calls can call specific version or by default will get latest version.
    Events are passed to a Lambda function as an event input parameter. The event parameter may contain multiple events in a single             call, based on the batch size you request. This is for streaming events.
