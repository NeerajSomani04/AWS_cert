SQS (Simple Queue Service) -->
  offers a reliable, highly-scalable, hosted queue for storing messages in transit between computers.
  helps you focus on building robust, sophisticated message-based applications, without worring about loosing any messages.
  user can build message based workflow process applications.

Amazon SQS different from Amazon SNS -->
   Amazon SNS allows applications to send time-critical messages to multiple subscribers through a “push” mechanism
   Amazon SQS is a message queue service used by distributed applications to exchange messages through a polling model, and can be used to decouple sending and receiving components

Example:- A common pattern is to use SNS to publish messages to Amazon SQS queues to reliably send messages to one or many system components asynchronously. 

Amazon SQS different from Amazon MQ -->
  If you're using messaging with existing applications, and want to move your messaging to the cloud quickly and easily, we recommend you consider Amazon MQ. 
  for any new cloud based application SQS and SNS are recommened.

message queuing ordering --> FIFO (first-in-first-out)
SQS, provide at-least-once delivery. FIFO queues provide exactly-once processing, message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes it and deletes it.
Duplicates not allowed.

SQS different from Amazon Kinesis Streams -->
  Use Amazon SQS when you need each unique message to be consumed only once and for below like use cases:
      Decoupling the components of an application
      Configuring individual message delay:
      Dynamically increasing concurrency or throughput at read time
      Scaling transparently
  Use Amazon Kinesis Streams when you need multiple consumers to be able to process each record and for below like use cases:
      Routing related records to the same record processor
      Allowing multiple applications to consume the same stream concurrently
 
 SQS Billing --> Pay only for what you use
    SQS is calculated by per request, plus data transfer charges for data transferred out of Amazon SQS (unless data is transferred to
      Amazon EC2 instances or to AWS Lambda functions within the same region)(means, no charges for SQS to EC2 or Lambda in same region).
    By grouping messages into batches (Batch operations), you can reduce your Amazon SQS costs.
