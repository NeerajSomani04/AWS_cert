Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) --> web service that provides resizable compute capacity
  default limit of EC2 instances --> total 20 
      for On-demand --> 20
      for reserved --> 20
      for spot --> dynamic sport limit
      
    two type of virtualization in EC2 -->
         Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM) --> 
          Paravirtual Machine (PVM) --> 
          
Benefits --> Scale up and down as per demand (auto scaling)
  --> pay for only for you use (pay-as-you-go model)
  --> Different instances has differnt price (based on compute resources capacity)
  --> Amazon EC2 use ECC memory
  --> complete control on compute configuration, intiation and shutdown, 
  
  
CLI API for initiating (running) an EC2 instance --> RunInstances API call
for status or info about EC2 --> DescribeInstances
for terminating EC2 -> TerminateInstances

If EC2 instances using Amazon EBS boot partition --> 
    StopInstances --> to stop EC2 and release compute resources but keep EBS volume
    StartInstances --> to restart EC2

difference between using the local instance store and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) for the root device??
Answer:- for Amazon EBS -->  data persist even if you stop or restart instances
         for local store --> you will loose data even if you restart or stop 

Amazon Machine Image (AMI) --> packaged-up environment, includes OS, applications etc (e.g., webservers, appservers, and databases)

User can access EC2 by using DNS provided. or Public IPs.

Limitations --> 
    --> In sending number of emails, because of performace impact
    --> 20 limit of EC2 instances

EC2 billing --> charged as per instnace usage and data transfer
    --> charges intiates when EC2 initiates the boot sequence of an AMI instance, and till instnace stopped or terminated
    --> if data is transferred between these two instances, it is charged at "Data Transfer Out from EC2 to Another AWS Region" for the first instance and at "Data Transfer In from Another AWS Region" for the second instance. 
    --> charges calculated based on a per second basis

EC2 Hardware Information --> 
  EC2 Instance Types --> 
    a. General purpose --> T, M
    b. Compute Optimized --> c
    c. Memory Optimized --> R, X
    d. Accelerated computing --> G, P, F
    e. storage optimized --> H, I, D
    

    What is an “EC2 Compute Unit” -->
        The amount of CPU that is allocated to a particular instance is expressed in terms of these EC2 Compute Units. 

EC2 Security -->
    You can create arbitrary groups and even control over which IP subnets on the Internet may talk to which groups. 

EC2 and Elastic IP -->
    By default, all accounts are limited to 5 Elastic IP addresses per region. 
    --> for efficiently using the Elastic IP addresses, we impose a small hourly charge for each address when it is not associated to a running instance.
  
  Q: Do I need one Elastic IP address for every instance that I have running?
  Answer:- No. You do not need an Elastic IP address for all your instances. By default, every instance comes with a private IP address 
  and an internet routable public IP address. The private address is associated exclusively with the instance and is only returned 
  to Amazon EC2 when the instance is stopped or terminated. The public address is associated exclusively with the instance until it 
  is stopped, terminated or replaced with an Elastic IP address. 
  

EC2 and AZs --> 
    --> We do not currently support the ability to coordinate launches into the same Availability Zone across AWS developer accounts. One Availability Zone name (for example, us-east-1a) in two AWS customer accounts may relate to different physical Availability Zones.

EC2 -- Nitro Hypervisor -->
    C5 instances introduced Nitro Hypervisor. 
    Benefit --> 
      --> primarily provides CPU and memory isolation
      --> provides consistent performance and increased compute and memory resources 
      
  Many EC2’s use of its Xen-based hypervisor as well.
  
  Q: How many EBS volumes and Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) can be attached to instances running on the Nitro Hypervisor
  Answer: 27 in total including EBS and ENI
  
EC2 and Enhanced Networking -->
    --> using SR-IOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization) 
        --> provides higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization
        --> higher packet per second (PPS) performance, lower inter-instance latencies, and very low network jitter.
        --> no additional charges for this
        --> its is supported only EC2-VPC type
    --> to enable this feature, you must launch an HVM AMI with the appropriate drivers. 
    --> For AMIs that do not contain these drivers, you will need to download and install the appropriate drivers based on the instance types you plan to use. 
    --> many advance networking features are not supported by EC2-Classic

EC2 and Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) -->
      data store on EC2-local instnace will not persist after you terminate or stop instance.
      EBS backed EC2 instances can keep your data even after you terminate or stop instance, by setting Delete On Terminate flag to "N".
      --> four EBS volume types and divided into two categories: 
         1. --> SSD-backed storage for transactional workloads (performance depends primarily on IOPS)
         2. --> HDD-backed storage for throughput intensive workloads. (performance depends primarily on throughput, measured in MB/s)

Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) --> ideal for frequently accessed, throughput intensive workloads with large datasets and large I/O sizes
Cold HDD (sc1) --> ideal for less frequently accessed workloads with large, cold datasets. lowest cost per GB

Limitation --> 
    --> multiple instances to one volume is not supported 
    --> EBS snapshots are only available through the Amazon EC2 APIs.
    
 EBS Snapshots --> point in time copy of EBS volume
      --> snapshots can be done in real time while the volume is attached and in use.
      --> we recommend shutting down the machine to take a clean snapshot. So, that snapshots don't miss any unwritten data at any point in time.
      snapshots versioned --> Each snapshot is given a unique identifier, and customers can create volumes based on any of their existing snapshots.
      --> If you share a snapshot, you won’t be charged when other users make a copy of your snapshot. If you make a copy of another user’s shared volume, you will be charged normal EBS rates.
      --> find snapshots that have been shared with you by selecting “Private Snapshots”
      --> find snapshots that have been shared globally by selecting “Public Snapshots”
      --> EBS offers seamless encryption of data volumes and snapshots. 
 
 EC2 and Elastic File Storage (EFS) -->
      --> you can mount the file system on EC2 using Linux mount command and the file system’s DNS name
      --> Amazon EFS supports one to thousands of Amazon EC2 instances connecting to a file system concurrently.
      
      Q. How do I access my file system from outside my VPC?
      Answer:- Amazon EC2 instances within your VPC can access your file system directly, and Amazon EC2 Classic instances outside your VPC can mount a file system via ClassicLink. On-premises servers can mount your file systems via an AWS Direct Connect connection to your VPC.
    
 EC2 and Amazon CloudWatch --> 
    --> 1 min granularity
    --> user can get EC2 instance matric data up to 2 weeks from the time you started to monitor it
    --> monitoring data can be archived beyond 2 weeks using "mon-get-stats" command, inot S3 or SimpleDB
    --> CloudWatch stores metrics for terminated Amazon EC2 instances or deleted Elastic Load Balancers for 2 weeks.
    --> CloudWatch monitoring charge does not vary by Amazon EC2 instance type.

Different Types of EC2 instances --> 
    1. Reserved Instances --> resevation and discount available based on 1year or 3 year terms
              Standard RI --> discount on regular Resevred Instance
              Convertible RI --> discounted reserved instance with capability to change your instance configuration during the term
              Zonal RI --> when RI is scoped to a specific AZ (advantage of the capacity reservation)
              Regional RI --> when RI is scoped to specific region and all AZ within that Region 
                      --> If you do not require the capacity reservation then use Regional RI. 
                      --> provide AZ and instance size flexibility, which offers broader applicability of the RI’s discounted rate.
                        -->  instance size flexibility means it applies your RI’s discounted rate to usage of any instnace size within an instance family. (two m5.xlarge instances in us-east-1a or four m5.large instances in us-east-1b.)
      very imp point --->  Only Linux/Unix based Regional RI provides instance size flexibility. Not other OS based.
      Limitation --->
          --> RIs do not apply to Spot instances or instances running on Dedicated Hosts.
      
      Convertible RI in Detail -->
          --> Instances  that can be changed during the term.
          -->  can select a new instance type, operating system, tenancy, or payment option
          --> you dont need to pay any fee for the service, but need to pay the price difference between different type of instances
          --> You cannot convert your Convertible RI for Convertible RI(s) of a lesser total value.
          --> different payment options, like all-upfront, no-upfront (hourly), partial-upfront
      Reserved Instance Marketplace
         --> place where People can sell their customized EC2
         --> this is a good place for people you purchased with some plan in mind but half-way through decided not needed and sell it to others to cover the cost

    2. Spot Instance ---> 
            --> its AWS spare capacity EC2 available at any give point in time
            --> can save upto 90% as compared to on-Demand EC2
            --> AWS can interrupt with a 2-minute notification and can be used along with On-Demand and Reserved Instances.
            --> there is a limit for no of spot instances per customer per region (depends of customer to customer basis)
            --> Each spot capacity pool can have a different price based on supply and demand.
            -->
        Limitation -->
              Linux/UNIX and Windows Server are available. Windows Server with SQL Server is not currently available.
              you can't use Spot instance with a paid AMI for third-party software (such as IBM’s software packages)
              Q. When would my Spot instance get interrupted?
              Answwer: - two possible reasons, with the primary one being Amazon EC2 capacity requirements (e.g. On Demand or Reserved Instance usage). Secondarily, if you have chosen to set a “maximum Spot price” and the Spot price rises above this, your instance will be reclaimed with a two-minute notification. 
              Hibernate vs Stop Spot Instances --> 
              --> In the case of Hibernate, your instance gets hibernated and the RAM data persisted. In the case of Stop, your instance gets shutdown and RAM is cleared.
              --> In both cases EBS volume persists, also you need to choose proper EBS volume for Hibernation option
              --> Stop-start and hibernate-resume cycles are controlled by Amazon EC2.
              --> Spot Fleet allows you to automatically request and manage multiple Spot instances
              --> No, we do not support multi-region Fleet requests. But user can lauch multi-AZ spot fleet request.
              --> RequestSpotFleet API provides two allocation strategies: lowestPrice and diversified ( for needed target capacity).

    3. Micro Instances -->
              -->  provide a small amount of consistent CPU resources
              --> if you have a relatively low throughput application or web site with an occasional need to consume significant compute cycles, we recommend using Micro instances.
    
    4. Compute Optimized -->
        --> high compute power
        --> C5 and C4
        
    5. Accelerated Computing Instances --> 
          --> use hardware accelerators, or co-processors, to perform some functions, with better performance
          --> three types
              – GPU compute instances for general-purpose computing --> for massive parallel processing
              -- GPU graphics instances for graphics intensive applications
              -- FPGA programmable hardware compute instances for advanced scientific workloads.
         --> P3 / G3 / 
         --> P3 instances will support EC2-VPC only.
         --> EC2 F1 is a compute instance with programmable hardware. F instances --> FPGA
      
     6. Cluster compute Instance -->
          --> specifically engineered to provide high performance networking with high performance
          --> Cluster GPU Instances provide general-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) with proportionally high CPU and increased network performance
          High Memory Cluster Instances  --> large amounts of memory and CPU capabilities with networking capabilities
            ---> cluster placement group is a logical entity that enables creating a cluster of instances and launching in group
            
     7. High I/O Instances -->
              --> deliver very high, low latency, I/O capacity to applications
              --> Cluster instances, High I/O instances can be clustered via cluster placement groups for low latency networking.
              --> High I/O instances are not available as decicated host instances.
              --> best suited for OLTP applications,
              
     8. General Purpose Instnaces --> 
          --> good choice for running development and test environments (M5 Instnaces)
          -->
