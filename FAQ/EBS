** EBS Volume Types:
1. General Purpose SSD (GP2) --> solid state drive
    > balance in price and performance
    > upto 10000 IOPS
    
2. Provisioned IOPs SSD (IO1)
    > designed for I/O intensive applications such as large RDBMS, NoSQL
    > more than 10000 IOPS (upto 20000)
    
Magnetic storage Volume (Harddisk drive)
3. Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1) --> 
    > Big Data
    > Data Warehouse
    > Log Processing
    > They can't be bootable
    > sequnential read/write
    > frequently accesss workload

4. Cold HDD (SC1)
    > Low cost storage
    > file server 
    > They cant be bootable
    
5. Magnetic (Standard) --> same as cold but bootable
    > lowest cost volumes that is bootable


SSD-backed storage for transactional workloads (performance depends primarily on IOPS)
HDD-backed storage for throughput workloads (performance depends primarily on throughput, measured in MB/s)
