Elastic Load Balancing supports three types :- 
    ALB (Application Load Balancer) --> flexible application management and TLS termination
        --> Supports HTTP and HTTPs protocols
        --> TCP ports: 1-65535
        --> HTTP/2 support is enabled natively
    NLB (Network Load Balancer) --> for extreme performance and static IP need
              --> support only TCP (Layer 4) listeners.
    CLB (Classic Load Balancer) --> recommanded only for EC2-Classic based applications
    
by creating VPC Endpoints --> privately access ELB from VPC without public IP address. This uses Private IP addresses powered by AWS PrivateLink.
User can migrate from CLB to ALB but can't convert it directly.
