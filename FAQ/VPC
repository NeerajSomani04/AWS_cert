Important Definitions:-

A Virtual Private Cloud: A logically isolated virtual network in the AWS cloud. You define a VPC’s IP address space from ranges you select.
Subnet: A segment of a VPC’s IP address range where you can place groups of isolated resources.
Internet Gateway: The Amazon VPC side of a connection to the public Internet.
NAT Gateway: A highly available, managed Network Address Translation (NAT) service for your resources in a private subnet to access the Internet.
Hardware VPN Connection: A hardware-based VPN connection between your Amazon VPC and your datacenter, home network, or co-location facility.
Virtual Private Gateway: The Amazon VPC side of a VPN connection.
Customer Gateway: Your side of a VPN connection.
Router: Routers interconnect subnets and direct traffic between Internet gateways, virtual private gateways, NAT gateways, and subnets.
Peering Connection: A peering connection enables you to route traffic via private IP addresses between two peered VPCs.
VPC Endpoints: Enables private connectivity to services hosted in AWS, from within your VPC without using an an Internet Gateway, VPN, Network Address Translation (NAT) devices, or firewall proxies.
Egress-only Internet Gateway: A stateful gateway to provide egress only access for IPv6 traffic from the VPC to the Internet.

Currently VPC has below 4 options:-
VPC with a Single Public Subnet Only
VPC with Public and Private Subnets
VPC with Public and Private Subnets and Hardware VPN Access
VPC with a Private Subnet Only and Hardware VPN Access

Endpoints are horizontally scalable and highly available virtual devices that allow communication between instances in your VPC and AWS services.

VPC offers two different types of endpoints: 
Gateway type endpoints --> Only for AWS services, These endpoints will add an entry to your route table you selected and route the traffic to the supported services.
Interface type endpoints --> provide private connectivity to services powered by PrivateLink, being AWS services, your own services or SaaS solutions, and supports connectivity over Direct Connect.

Billing -->
  No additional charges for VPC.
  Although, for Hardware VPN connection,  pricing is per VPN connection-hour, Partial hours are billed as full hours.
  
  If you access AWS resources via your VPN connection, you will incur Internet data transfer charges.
  Not if you are using Internet Gateway.
  
Connectivity --> 
  Multiple ways to connect to VPC:-
    You may connect your VPC to:
      The Internet (via an Internet gateway)
      Your corporate data center using a Hardware VPN connection (via the virtual private gateway)
      Both the Internet and your corporate data center (utilizing both an Internet gateway and a virtual private gateway)
      Other AWS services (via Internet gateway, NAT, virtual private gateway, or VPC endpoints)
      Other VPCs (via VPC peering connections) 

   Instances without public IP addresses can access the Internet in one of two ways:
    >> through a NAT gateway or a NAT instance to access
    >> hardware VPN connection or Direct Connect connection, instances can route their Internet traffic down the virtual private gateway to your existing datacenter
