Imp points to remember -->
Using the SQS console, users should create the SQS queue prior to subscribing it to a SNS Topic. 
Amazon SNS does not currently support forwarding messages to Amazon SQS FIFO queues. You can use SNS to forward messages to standard queues.
SNS for deliveries over HTTP, HTTPS, Email-JSON and SQS transport protocols will consist of a simple JSON object,

Users can receive notifications from Amazon SNS in two ways: 
  In both cases, the owner of the subscription endpoint needs to explicitly opt-in and confirm the subscription by replying to confirmation message sent by Amazon SNS.
    >> Users with AWS IDs:
    >> Other users: Topic owners can subscribe and register end-points on behalf of users without AWS IDs.
    
 Token included in the confirmation message sent to end-points on a subscription request are valid for 3 days.
