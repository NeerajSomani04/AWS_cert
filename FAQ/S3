S3 (simple storage service) --> object storage
You can store virtually any kind of data in any format.
objects size 0 bytes to 5 TB
simple key-based object storage service
REST web services interface
Pay-as-you-go pricing and unlimited capacity 
objects are automatically stored across multiple AZ (3) within specified region
Region is a geographic location, which contains one or more AZ (which is isolated location, which are connected with low latency, high throughput, and highly redundant networking.)



S3 Storage Classes --> 4 types:
    1. S3 Standard --> high durability, availability, and performance. S3 Lifecycle management offers configurable policies to 
              automatically migrate objects to the most appropriate storage class.
    2. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access --> accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed.
          high durability, high throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard, with a low per GB storage price and per GB retrieval fee. 
          Lifecycle management offers
    3. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access --> stores data in a single AZ. accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed.
              costs 20% less than Standard-Infrequent Access
    4. Amazon Glacier --> secure, durable, and extremely low-cost storage service for data archiving. 
              provides three options for access to archives, from a few minutes to several hours.
  
S3 Billing --> Pay-as-you-go
      Billing prices are based on the location of your bucket.
      no Data Transfer charge within Region
      COPY request between AWS Regions is charged at standard rates
      Billing calculation based on following -->
          a. storage used
          b. Network Data Transferred In:
          c. Network Data Transferred Out:
          d. Data Requests: (Get/ PUT/ Delete requests)
          e. Data Retrieval: only applies to --> S3 Standard-IA and S3 One Zone-IA storage classes
      
      Normal Amazon S3 rates apply for every version of an object stored or requested.
      There is option to configure your bucket as a Requester Pays bucket, in which case the requester will pay the cost of requests and downloads of your Amazon S3 data.
      
 Security --> S3 is secure by default. 
      --> User can do SSE (server side encryption)
      --> user can enable encryption option -- S3 buckets to automatically encrypt objects before storing them. (SSL encryption)
    
    control access to S3 --> 4 ways:
            Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, --> users, groups, roles access
            bucket policies, --> customers can define rules which apply broadly across all requests
            Access Control Lists (ACLs), --> customers can grant specific permissions (i.e. READ, WRITE, FULL_CONTROL) to specific users for an individual bucket or object
            and Query String Authentication. --> customers can create a URL to an Amazon S3 object which is only valid for a limited time.
 
     auditing controls --> 
          configure S3 bucket to create access log records for all requests
          
     S3 Data Encryption at Rest --> 4 ways
          SSE-S3 --> Amazon handles key management and key protection
          SSE-C --> if you want to maintain your own encryption keys, but donâ€™t want to implement or leverage a client-side encryption library.
          SSE-KMS --> usage master key on top of encryption key providing an additional layer of control. AWS KMS provides an audit trail logs.
          encryption client library --> you retain control of the keys and complete the encryption and decryption of objects client-side
