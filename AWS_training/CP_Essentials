1. Lecture 2 - Basic Cloud concepts

cloud computing:- 
  refers to delivering ondemand IT resources and applications by internet (online) with pay as you go pricing.
  elasticity, scalability and reliability of computing resources.
Region:
  physical location in the world
  contains multiple availability zones
Availability zones:
  one or more discrete data centers.
  redundent: power/ networking/ connectivity
  housed in seperate facilities.
  
Applications highly available:
  1. fault tolerance: 
      application operational during component failure
      built-in redundancy of components.
  2. always functioning and accessible. minimul downtime and without need of human intervention.
  
  Cloud Elastisity vs cloud scalability:
  in majority they work hand-in-hand.
  Elastisity:-- ability to grow and shrink as per need.
  scalability:-- Scalability includes the ability to increase workload size within existing infrastructure 
  (hardware, software, etc.) without impacting performance. but if needed then with elastic nature of application, it can scale-in/out as well.
  Everything depends on application demand with low latency.
  
  AWS tools for elasticity and scalibility:
  1. Auto Scaling
  2. Elastic load balancing
  
Security and compliance requirement:
1. customer has full control on region where data located.
2. auditing is periodic and munual as per need with full governance capability.
3. Data centers are completely secure as per goverment and industry standards. 

Reliability:
    1. ability to recover from infrastructure failure
    2. dynamically and automatically, acquire resources as per demand to mitigate disruption.
    3. no need to predict and plan upfront for everything at once. Work on apllication and infrastructure as per need.
