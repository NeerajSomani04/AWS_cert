# AWS EventBridge
- CloudWatch Events and EventBridge have visibility over events generated by supported AWS services within an account.
- They can monitor the default account event bus and pattern match events flowing through and deliver these events to multiple targets.
- They are also the source of scheduled events which can perform certain actions at certain times of day, days of the week, or multiple combinations of both - using the Unix CRON time expression format.
- Both services are one way how event driven architectures can be implemented within AWS.
- EventBridge is a service replacing cloudWatch events.
- In addition to cloudWatch events functionality, EventBridge is more roburst.
- It can also handle events from third parties, as well as custom applications.
- In cloudWatch events there is only one event bus, and its not exposed in UI (implicit). Its used behind the scene.
- But EventBridge can have additional event buses.
- Two type of events possible:
  - Event pattern based rule
  - Schedule based rule
