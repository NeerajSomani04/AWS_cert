# High Availability (HA), Fault-Tolerance (FT) and Disaster Recover (DR) 

### HA
- aims to ensure an agreed level of operational performance, usually uptime, for a higher than normal period.
  - HA is not aiming to stop failure
  - instead, its a design when system fails, its components can be replaced/fixed as quickly as possible
  - often, by using some way of automation
  - HA is not about User experience
