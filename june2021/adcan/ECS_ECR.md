### Containers
- Solves problems of Virtualization
- So what is virtualization?
  - Ideally, it should be called as OS virtualization.
  - Its a process of running multiple Operating system on same physical hardware.
  - These multiple OS is almost identical and consume a lot of machine resources in creating virtual environment and not supporting application tasks.
  - This problem is solved by containers.
- Container Engine (Docker)
  - A continer conceptually very similar to VM, but with a small twick.
  - a container runs as a process within the host OS. Hence, opposite of vitualization which runs multiple OS on top of host OS and hypervisor.
  - A container Engine can utilized the host OS capability to deal with networking and file I/O.
