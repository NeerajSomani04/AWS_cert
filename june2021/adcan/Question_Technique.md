- scenario like, website, application, 
- actual question itself is 1 or 2 lines
- at the associate level - generally answer is simple right and wrong
- occasionally 'most suitable' from some right answers
- use process of elimination
- most questions have an overall criteria or restriction
  - example, cost effective, security best practice
  - highest performance, meaning a trade-off between performance vs cost, and you need to choose performance
  - timeframe restriction (how long a solution will take to implement)
