  - 50 Service limit checks
    - checks for 80% limit of those services, alerts you as soon as you reach 80% limit on those services
- **exam imp** what are special in Business or enterprise support plan?
  - you get the same core 7 basic check, plus..
  - you get 115 further additional checks (14 cost, 17 security, 24 fault tolerant, 10 performance and 50 service limit)
  - you also get access to these checks via the AWS support APIs
    - this gives more convenience to allow programmatically access to summaries and detailed information for the trusted advisor checks.
    - you can even get the status of these checks, when it was done last time, etc..
    - hence, you can build your own account check support system with programatic access to Trusted advisor.
    - it also allows you to programmatically open a support case, get list and detailed information about support cases, perform some of kind of search or filtering in support cases by dates or identifiers,
    - it even allows you to add communications or attachment to your existing support cases, add additional email receipients for any current cases
    - and even allows you to programatically resolve your cases.
  - there was an exam question based on this -- "checking service limits and logging a service support ticket automatically for an increase in limit"
  - which service will you use to perform above task, one solution could be Trusted Advisor but with business or enterprise level support.
  - with this support plan you get "CloudWatch Integration" -- means you can build a event driven system in response to any changes in your account.
