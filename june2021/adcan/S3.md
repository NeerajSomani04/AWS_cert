# Simple Storage Service (S3)
- It provides a near infinitely scalable object storage platform - accessible from anywhere with a public internet connection.
- read all S3 basics from this link (https://github.com/acantril/aws-sa-associate-saac02/blob/master/04-AWS-Fundamentals/00_LearningAids/S3Basics.pdf)
- **S3 is PRIVATE by default**
- by default only the person who created the bucket originally has access to it, permission to all other identity needs to be provided seperately.


### S3 Security (Resource Policies & ACLs)
- S3 Security is controlled via a combination of Identity Policies, Bucket Policies (Resource Policies) and Legacy Bucket and Object ACLs
- Bucket Policy Examples : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html
- S3 bucket policy is a type of resource policy.
- A resource policy is just like an identity policy, but as the name suggest they are attached to resources instead of identities.
- The difference between resource policy and identity policy is all about perspective.
- Resource policy provides resource perspective permissions.
- With identity policy you are controlling what that identity can access, with resource policy you are controlling who can access that resource.
- Resource policy allow or deny permission to resources in same account or different accounts
- Resource policies can also allow or deny anonymous principals. 
  - Here principles means, AWS services like lambda, Ec2, etc, but not limited to AWS. Any other external application can also get permission, example, gmail account, dropbox, etc.
  - resource policies can be used to open a bucket to the world by referencing all principles even those not authenticated by AWS.
- Resource policy has one major difference to identity policy, that is presence of explicit "principal" component in the policy statement.
- There can be only one bucket policy per bucket, but it can have multiple statements.

### Identity Polices
- you can only attach identity policies to identities in your own account
- Hence, identity policy can only control security inside your own account.


## ACL (Access Control List)
- Its a way to apply security to objects and buckets
- They are sub-resource of that object or of that bucket
- Legacy, means its old, AWS don't recommend using it and prefer to use bucket policies instead.
- The reason it got removed, because its very inflexible and can perform very simple permission configurations. for example, they can't have conditions like bucket polcies.
- In general, there are only 5 permissions can be applied using ACL. which itself is very limited.
- ACL can be applied only on single object or single bucket. You can't apply it to group of objects or group of buckets.

### Block Public Access Settings
- This can be applied to only anonymous principles, meaning the identity or services that are not authenticated by your AWS account.
- The first out of four option, is to block public access that could be caused by any new ACL implemented.
- second option, to block public access granted by any ACL either new or old
- third option, allows any existing public access granted by bucket policies or access point policies. 
- fourth option, blocks both any existing and new bucket policies, from granting any public access.

### Exam powerup 
- Identity : Controlling different resources (bucket)
- Identity : You have a preference for IAM
- Identity : Same account
- Bucket : Just controlling S3
- Bucket : Anonymous or cross account
- ACLs : Never - Unless you must

### S3 Static Website Hosting
- Accessing S3 is generally done via APIs
- Static Website Hosting is a feature of the product which lets you define a HTTP endpoint, set index and error documents and use S3 like a website.
- S3 Pricing : https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/
- Website endpoint is created
- custom domain via R53 - Bucketname matters

# S3 pricing
- based on storage
- based on data transfer, transfer data into S3 is free, but transfer data out of S3 is charged
- based on request operations (get, post, put, delete)
- based on management and analytics (s3 data analytics features)

### S3 Object versioning & MFA Delete
- Object versioning is a feature which can be enabled on an S3 bucket - allowing the bucket to store multi versions of objects
- These objects can be referenced by their version ID to interact directly - or omit this to reference the latest version of an object
- Objects aren't deleted - object deletion markers are put in place to hide objects.
- By default versioning is disabled, and user can enable it as per need. But once enabled, it can't be disabled.
- Although, versioning can be suspended and can be re-enabled again.
- When versioning of object is disabled, ID of the object is "NULL". But when versioning is enabled, every action (update/delete) creates new ID (random unique value) for that object to maintain versioning.
- If you want to retrieve a specific version of the object then just pass ID information as well in you request. If you don't specify ID means, you want the latest version of the object.
- In case of delete operation, S3 just put a delete marker on that specific object. This will hide the object from accessing it. but in reality this object is not deleted from bucket. you can remove this delete marker from object to retrieve this object back be accessible.
- Its possible to delete an object permanently, by specifying its ID with delete action.
- **MFADelete** 
  - its enabled in versioning configuration
  - means, MFA is required to change bucket versioning state
  - MFA is required to delete versions

### S3 performance optimization
