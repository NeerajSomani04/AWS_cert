# Simple Storage Service (S3)
- It provides a near infinitely scalable object storage platform - accessible from anywhere with a public internet connection.
- read all S3 basics from this link (https://github.com/acantril/aws-sa-associate-saac02/blob/master/04-AWS-Fundamentals/00_LearningAids/S3Basics.pdf)
- **S3 is PRIVATE by default**
- by default only the person who created the bucket originally has access to it, permission to all other identity needs to be provided seperately.


### S3 Security (Resource Policies & ACLs)
- S3 Security is controlled via a combination of Identity Policies, Bucket Policies (Resource Policies) and Legacy Bucket and Object ACLs
- Bucket Policy Examples : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html
- S3 bucket policy is a type of resource policy.
- A resource policy is just like an identity policy, but as the name suggest they are attached to resources instead of identities.
- The difference between resource policy and identity policy is all about perspective.
- Resource policy provides resource perspective permissions.
- With identity policy you are controlling what that identity can access, with resource policy you are controlling who can access that resource.
- Resource policy allow or deny permission to resources in same account or different accounts
- Resource policies can also allow or deny anonymous principals. 
  - Here principles means, AWS services like lambda, Ec2, etc, but not limited to AWS. Any other external application can also get permission, example, gmail account, dropbox, etc.
  - resource policies can be used to open a bucket to the world by referencing all principles even those not authenticated by AWS.
- Resource policy has one major difference to identity policy, that is presence of explicit "principal" component in the policy statement.
- There can be only one bucket policy per bucket, but it can have multiple statements.

### Identity Polices
- you can only attach identity policies to identities in your own account
- Hence, identity policy can only control security inside your own account.


## ACL (Access Control List)
- Its a way to apply security to objects and buckets
- They are sub-resource of that object or of that bucket
- Legacy, means its old, AWS don't recommend using it and prefer to use bucket policies instead.
- The reason it got removed, because its very inflexible and can perform very simple permission configurations. for example, they can't have conditions like bucket polcies.
- In general, there are only 5 permissions can be applied using ACL. which itself is very limited.
- ACL can be applied only on single object or single bucket. You can't apply it to group of objects or group of buckets.

### Block Public Access Settings
- This can be applied to only anonemous principles, meaning the identity or services that are not authenticated by your AWS account.



### Exam powerup 
- Identity : Controlling different resources (bucket)
- Identity : You have a preference for IAM
- Identity : Same account
- Bucket : Just controlling S3
- Bucket : Anonymous or cross account
- ACLs : Never - Unless you must
