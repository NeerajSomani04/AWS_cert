# AWS Fundamentals

### AWS Public vs Private services in terms of networking only
- meaning by default no permissions to anyone aside from account root user
- When connecting to AWS service there are 2 components
  - connectivity to that service - the device like laptop, mobile, can communicate to that service using a network
  - if we connect, do we have permission to access that service
- the difference between public and private services is the connectivity, its a networking difference.
- AWS services are not directly available on public internet. You need to create a connection between AWS public zone and public internet to connect to AWS services.



### AWS Global Infrastructure - https://www.infrastructure.aws/
- AWS have created a global public cloud platform which consists of isolated 'regions' connected together by high speed global networking.
- Regions
- Availability Zones
- Edge Locations
