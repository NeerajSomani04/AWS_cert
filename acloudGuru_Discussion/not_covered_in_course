things Not covered in the course as per discussion from people:

1. Options on authenticating using LDAP together with IAM. LDAP integration, S3 optimization
2. Know/review limits for S3, DynamoDB, EC2, SNS, and SQS. Understanding the service limits would have helped with at least 5 questions.
3. which AWS services are key-based and which platforms Elastic Beanstalk supports (in addition to which resources it can create, as mentioned by the OP)
4. DynamoDB questions about hash and range keys
5. How do you register devices for Amazon Mobile Devices and SNS Mobile Push notifiations. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/mobile-push-send-devicetoken.html

one exam question:
The exact question was along the line of You have created an app that uses SNS Mobile Push notifications for a number of mobile devices. 
However the client does not know how to add the large number of devices. You think you should be able to add the devices to 
Amazon Mobile Devices easy enough: you do (choose one). Let Amazon Mobile Devices and the application take care of it. (Something else). 
Upload a CSV of all the token serial numbers into the AWS Console. You use the CreatePlatformEndpoint API to upload the device serial 
numbers (or tokens, can't remember).

Answer:
use CreatePlatformEndpoint is correct way to do. You can add device tokens and registration IDs to Amazon SNS using the following methods: • Manually add a single token to AWS using the AWS Management Console • Migrate existing tokens from a CSV file to AWS using the AWS Management Console • Upload several tokens using the CreatePlatformEndpoint API • Register tokens from devices that will install your apps in the future
