Anav's suggestion in comments -->
video's and at least finish the EC2,S3,SQS,SNS and DynamoDB faQ's . Coming to sample question read all the 20 sample questions .Almost 50 % of them will come in exam and Exam will be less complicated than sample paper but make sure you know the limits and Basic API's like DescribeImages.
